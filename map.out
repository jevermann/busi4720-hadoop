PREFACE.	1
The	1
play	1
of	1
_Hamlet_	1
is	1
above	1
all	1
others	1
the	1
most	1
stupendous	1
monument	1
of	1
Shakespeare's	1
genius,	1
standing	1
as	1
a	1
beacon	1
to	1
command	1
the	1
wonder	1
and	1
admiration	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
memorial	1
to	1
future	1
generations,	1
that	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
its	1
author	1
was	1
moved	1
by	1
little	1
less	1
than	1
inspiration.	1
_Lear_,	1
with	1
its	1
sublime	1
picture	1
of	1
human	1
misery;--_Othello_,	1
with	1
its	1
harrowing	1
overthrow	1
of	1
a	1
nature	1
great	1
and	1
amiable;--_Macbeth_,	1
with	1
its	1
fearful	1
murder	1
of	1
a	1
monarch,	1
whose	1
"virtues	1
plead	1
like	1
angels	1
trumpet-tongued	1
against	1
the	1
deep	1
damnation	1
of	1
his	1
taking	1
off,"--severally	1
exhibit,	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
pre-eminent	1
degree,	1
all	1
those	1
mighty	1
elements	1
which	1
constitute	1
the	1
perfection	1
of	1
tragic	1
art--the	1
grand,	1
the	1
pitiful,	1
and	1
the	1
terrible.	1
_Hamlet_	1
is	1
a	1
history	1
of	1
mind--a	1
tragedy	1
of	1
thought.	1
It	1
contains	1
the	1
deepest	1
philosophy,	1
and	1
most	1
profound	1
wisdom;	1
yet	1
speaks	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
the	1
heart,	1
touching	1
the	1
secret	1
spring	1
of	1
every	1
sense	1
and	1
feeling.	1
Here	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
ideal	1
exaltation	1
of	1
character,	1
but	1
life	1
with	1
its	1
blended	1
faults	1
and	1
virtues,--a	1
gentle	1
nature	1
unstrung	1
by	1
passing	1
events,	1
and	1
thus	1
rendered	1
"out	1
of	1
tune	1
and	1
harsh."	1
The	1
original	1
story	1
of	1
Hamlet	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
Latin	1
pages	1
of	1
the	1
Danish	1
historian,	1
Saxo	1
Grammaticus,	1
who	1
died	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
1208.	1
Towards	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
sixteenth	1
century,	1
the	1
French	1
author,	1
Francis	1
de	1
Belleforest,	1
introduced	1
the	1
fable	1
into	1
a	1
collection	1
of	1
novels,	1
which	1
were	1
translated	1
into	1
English,	1
and	1
printed	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
quarto	1
black	1
letter	1
volume,	1
under	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
the	1
"Historie	1
of	1
Hamblett,"	1
from	1
which	1
source	1
Shakespeare	1
constructed	1
the	1
present	1
tragedy.	1
Saxo	1
has	1
placed	1
his	1
history	1
about	1
200	1
years	1
before	1
Christianity,	1
when	1
barbarians,	1
clothed	1
in	1
skins,	1
peopled	1
the	1
shores	1
of	1
the	1
Baltic.	1
The	1
poet,	1
however,	1
has	1
so	1
far	1
modernised	1
the	1
subject	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
Hamlet	1
a	1
Christian,	1
and	1
England	1
tributary	1
to	1
the	1
"sovereign	1
majesty	1
of	1
Denmark."	1
A	1
date	1
can	1
therefore	1
be	1
easily	1
fixed,	1
and	1
the	1
costume	1
of	1
the	1
tenth	1
and	1
eleventh	1
centuries	1
may	1
be	1
selected	1
for	1
the	1
purpose.	1
There	1
are	1
but	1
few	1
authentic	1
records	1
in	1
existence,	1
but	1
these	1
few	1
afford	1
reason	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
very	1
slight	1
difference	1
existed	1
between	1
the	1
dress	1
of	1
the	1
Dane	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Anglo-Saxon	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
period.	1
Since	1
its	1
first	1
representation,	1
upwards	1
of	1
two	1
centuries	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
ago,	1
no	1
play	1
has	1
been	1
acted	1
so	1
frequently,	1
or	1
commanded	1
such	1
universal	1
admiration.	1
It	1
draws	1
within	1
the	1
sphere	1
of	1
its	1
attraction	1
both	1
the	1
scholastic	1
and	1
the	1
unlearned.	1
It	1
finds	1
a	1
response	1
in	1
every	1
breast,	1
however	1
high	1
or	1
however	1
humble.	1
By	1
its	1
colossal	1
aid	1
it	1
exalts	1
the	1
drama	1
of	1
England	1
above	1
that	1
of	1
every	1
nation,	1
past	1
or	1
present.	1
It	1
is,	1
indeed,	1
the	1
most	1
marvellous	1
creation	1
of	1
human	1
intellect.	1

thee	1

_Fran._	1
For	1

much	1
thanks:	1
[_Crosses	1

'tis	1
bitter	1
cold,	1

If	1

Horatio	1
and	1
Marcellus,	1
The	1
rivals	1
of	1
my	1

bid	1

_Ber._	1
Say,	1
What,	1
is	1
Horatio	1
there?	1
_Hor._	1
(_Crosses	1

A	1
piece	1
of	1
him.[6]	1
_Ber._	1
(R.)	1
Welcome,	1
Horatio:	1
welcome,	1
good	1
Marcellus.	1
_Hor._	1
What,	1
has	1
this	1
thing	1
appear'd	1
again	1
to-night?	1
_Ber._	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
nothing.	1
_Mar._	1
(L.)	1
Horatio	1
says,	1
'tis	1
but	1
our	1
fantasy,	1
And	1
will	1
not	1
let	1
belief	1
take	1
hold	1
of	1
him,	1
Touching	1
this	1
dreaded	1
sight,	1
twice	1
seen	1
of	1
us:	1
Therefore	1
I	1
have	1
entreated	1
him,	1
along	1
With	1
us,	1
to	1
watch	1
the	1
minutes	1
of	1
this	1
night;[7]	1
That,	1
if	1
again	1
this	1
apparition	1
come,	1
He	1
may	1
approve	1
our	1
eyes,[8]	1
and	1
speak	1
to	1
it.	1
_Hor._	1
Tush!	1
tush!	1
'twill	1
not	1
appear.	1
_Ber._	1
Come,	1
let	1
us	1
once	1
again	1
assail	1
your	1
ears,	1
That	1
are	1
so	1
fortified	1
against	1
our	1
story,	1
What	1
we	1
two	1
nights	1
have	1
seen.[9]	1
_Hor._	1
Well,	1
let	1
us	1
hear	1
Bernardo	1
speak	1
of	1
this.	1
_Ber._	1
Last	1
night	1
of	1
all,	1
When	1
yon	1
same	1
star	1
that's	1
westward	1
from	1
the	1
pole	1
Had	1
made	1
his	1
course	1
to	1
illume	1
that	1
part	1
of	1
heaven	1
Where	1
now	1
it	1
burns,	1
Marcellus,	1
and	1
myself,	1
The	1
bell	1
then	1
beating	1
one--	1
_Mar._	1
Peace,	1
break	1
thee	1
off;	1
look,	1
where	1
it	1
comes	1
again!	1
_Enter_	1
Ghost	1
(L.H.)	1
_Ber._	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
figure,	1
like	1
the	1
king	1
that's	1
dead.	1
_Hor._	1
Most	1
like:--it	1
harrows	1
me	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
wonder.[10]	1
_Ber._	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
spoke	1
to.	1
_Mar._	1
Speak	1
to	1
it,	1
Horatio.	1
_Hor._	1
What	1
art	1
thou,	1
that	1
usurp'st	1
this	1
time	1
of	1
night,[11]	1
Together	1
with	1
that	1
fair	1
and	1
warlike	1
form	1
In	1
which	1
the	1
majesty	1
of	1
buried	1
Denmark	1
Did	1
sometimes	1
march?	1
By	1
heaven	1
I	1
charge	1
thee,	1
speak!	1
_Mar._	1
It	1
is	1
offended.	1
[Ghost	1
_crosses	1
to_	1
R.]	1
_Ber._	1
See!	1
it	1
stalks	1
away!	1
_Hor._	1
Stay!--speak!--speak,	1
I	1
charge	1
thee,	1
speak!	1
[_Exit_	1
Ghost,	1
R.H.]	1
_Mar._	1
'Tis	1
gone,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
answer.	1
_Ber._	1
How	1
now,	1
Horatio!	1
You	1
tremble,	1
and	1
look	1
pale:	1
Is	1
not	1
this	1
something	1
more	1
than	1
fantasy?	1
What	1
think	1
you	1
of	1
it?	1
_Hor._	1
Before	1
heaven,	1
I	1
might	1
not	1
this	1
believe,	1
Without	1
the	1
sensible	1
and	1
true	1
avouch[12]	1
Of	1
mine	1
own	1
eyes.	1
_Mar._	1
Is	1
it	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
king?	1
_Hor._	1
As	1
thou	1
art	1
to	1
thyself:	1
Such	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
armour	1
he	1
had	1
on,	1
When	1
he	1
the	1
ambitious	1
Norway	1
combated.	1
_Mar._	1
Thus,	1
twice	1

in	1
the	1

This	1
bodes	1
some	1
strange	1
eruption	1
to	1
our	1

In	1

palmy[17]	1

Rome,	1
A	1
little	1

The	1

'Tis	1

And	1
then	1
it	1
started	1
like	1
a	1
guilty	1
thing	1
Upon	1
a	1
fearful	1
summons.[20]	1
I	1
have	1
heard,	1
The	1
cock,	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
trumpet	1
of	1
the	1
morn,	1
Doth	1
with	1
his	1
lofty[21]	1

shrill-sounding	1

at	1
his	1
warning,	1
Whether	1
in	1
sea	1

in	1
earth	1

look,	1
the	1
morn,	1
in	1
russet	1
mantle	1
clad,	1
Walks	1
o'er	1
the	1
dew	1

yon	1
high	1

Break	1
we	1
our	1

up;	1
and,	1
by	1
my	1
advice,	1
Let	1
us	1
impart	1
what	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
to-night	1
Unto	1
young	1
Hamlet;	1
for,	1
upon	1
my	1

This	1

Attendants.	1
_King._	1
(R.C.)	1
Though	1
yet	1
of	1
Hamlet	1
our	1
dear	1
brother's	1
death	1
The	1
memory	1
be	1
green;[24]	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
us	1
befitted	1
To	1
bear	1
our	1
hearts	1
in	1
grief,	1
and	1
our	1
whole	1
kingdom	1
To	1
be	1
contracted	1
in	1
one	1
brow	1
of	1
woe;	1
Yet	1
so	1
far	1
hath	1
discretion	1
fought	1
with	1
nature,	1
That	1
we	1
with	1
wisest	1
sorrow[25]	1
think	1
on	1
him,	1
Together	1
with	1
remembrance	1
of	1
ourselves.	1
Therefore	1
our	1
sometime	1
sister,	1
now	1
our	1
queen,	1
The	1
imperial	1
jointress	1
of	1
this	1
warlike	1
state,	1
Have	1
we,	1
as	1
'twere	1
with	1
a	1
defeated	1
joy,[26]	1
Taken	1
to	1
wife:	1
nor	1
have	1
we	1
herein	1
barr'd[27]	1
Your	1
better	1
wisdoms,	1
which	1
have	1
freely	1
gone	1
With	1
this	1
affair	1
along:--For	1
all,	1
our	1
thanks.	1
And	1
now,	1
Laertes,	1
what's	1
the	1
news	1
with	1
you?	1
You	1
told	1
us	1
of	1
some	1
suit;	1
What	1
is't,	1
Laertes?	1
_Laer._	1
(R.)	1
My	1
dread	1
lord,	1
Your	1
leave	1
and	1
favour[28]	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
France;	1
From	1
whence	1
though	1
willingly	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
Denmark,	1
To	1
show	1
my	1
duty	1
in	1
your	1
coronation,	1
Yet	1
now,	1
I	1
must	1
confess,	1
that	1
duty	1
done,	1
My	1
thoughts	1
and	1
wishes	1
bend	1
again	1
toward	1
France,	1
And	1
bow	1
them	1
to	1
your	1
gracious	1
leave	1
and	1
pardon.	1
_King._	1
Have	1
you	1
your	1
father's	1
leave?	1
What	1
says	1
Polonious?	1
_Pol._	1
(R.)	1
He	1
hath,	1
my	1
lord,	1
(wrung	1
from	1
me	1
my	1
slow	1
leave	1
By	1
laboursome	1
petition;	1
and,	1
at	1
last,	1
Upon	1
his	1
will	1
I	1
sealed	1
my	1
hard	1
consent):[29]	1
I	1
do	1
beseech	1
you,	1
give	1
him	1
leave	1
to	1
go.	1
_King._	1
Take	1
thy	1
fair	1
hour,	1
Laertes;	1
time	1
be	1
thine,	1
And	1
thy	1
best	1
graces	1
spend	1
it	1
at	1
thy	1
will![30]	1
But	1
now,	1
my	1
cousin	1
Hamlet,	1
and	1
my	1
son,----	1
_Ham._	1
(L.)	1
A	1
little	1
more	1
than	1
kin,	1
and	1
less	1
than	1
kind.[31]	1
[Aside.]	1
_King._	1
How	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
the	1
clouds	1
still	1
hang	1
on	1
you?	1
_Ham._	1
Not	1
so,	1
my	1
lord;	1
I	1
am	1
too	1
much	1
i'the	1
sun.[32]	1
_Queen._(L.C.)	1
Good	1
Hamlet,	1
cast	1
thy	1
nighted	1
colour[33]	1
off,	1
And	1
let	1
thine	1
eye	1
look	1
like	1
a	1
friend	1
on	1
Denmark.	1
Do	1
not	1
for	1
ever	1
with	1
thy	1
vailed	1
lids[34]	1
Seek	1
for	1
thy	1
noble	1
father	1
in	1
the	1
dust:	1
Thou	1
know'st	1
'tis	1
common,	1
all	1
that	1
live	1
must	1
die,	1
Passing	1
through	1
nature	1
to	1
eternity.	1
_Ham._	1
Ay,	1
madam,	1
it	1
is	1
common.	1
_Queen._	1
If	1
it	1
be,	1
Why	1
seems	1
it	1
so	1
particular	1
with	1
thee?	1
_Ham._	1
Seems,	1
madam!	1
nay,	1
it	1
is;	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
seems.	1
'Tis	1
not	1
alone	1
my	1
inky	1
cloak,	1
good	1
mother,	1
Nor	1
the	1
dejected	1
haviour	1
of	1
the	1
visage,	1
No,	1
nor	1
the	1
fruitful	1
river	1
in	1
the	1
eye,	1
Together	1
with	1
all	1
forms,	1
modes,	1
shows	1
of	1
grief,	1
That	1
can	1
denote	1
me	1
truly:	1
These,	1
indeed,	1
seem,	1
For	1
they	1
are	1
actions	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
might	1
play.	1
But	1
I	1
have	1
that	1
within	1
which	1
passeth	1
show;[35]	1
These	1
but	1
the	1
trappings[36]	1
and	1
the	1
suits	1
of	1
woe.	1
_King._	1
'Tis	1
sweet	1
and	1
commendable	1
in	1
your	1
nature,	1
Hamlet,	1
To	1
give	1
these	1
mourning	1
duties	1
to	1
your	1
father:	1
But,	1
you	1
must	1
know,	1
your	1
father	1
lost	1
a	1
father;	1
That	1
father	1
lost,	1
lost	1
his;[37]	1
and	1
the	1
survivor	1
bound,	1
In	1
filial	1
obligation,	1
for	1
some	1
term	1
To	1
do	1
obsequious	1
sorrow:[38]	1
But	1
to	1
perséver[39]	1
In	1
obstinate	1
condolement,[40]	1
is	1
a	1
course	1
Of	1
impious	1
stubbornness;	1
'tis	1
unmanly	1
grief:	1
It	1
shows	1
a	1
will	1
most	1
incorrect	1
to	1
Heaven.[41]	1
We	1
pray	1
you,	1
throw	1
to	1
earth	1
This	1
unprevailing[42]	1
woe;	1
and	1
think	1
of	1
us	1
As	1
of	1
a	1
father:	1
for	1
let	1
the	1
world	1
take	1
note,	1
You	1
are	1
the	1
most	1
immediate	1
to	1
our	1
throne;	1
Our	1
chiefest	1
courtier,	1
cousin,	1
and	1
our	1
son.	1
_Queen._	1
Let	1
not	1
thy	1
mother	1
lose	1
her	1
prayers,	1
Hamlet:	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
stay	1
with	1
us;	1
go	1
not	1
to	1
Wittenberg.	1
_Ham._	1
I	1
shall	1
in	1
all	1
my	1
best	1
obey	1
you,	1
madam.	1
_King._	1
Why,	1
'tis	1
a	1
loving	1
and	1
a	1
fair	1
reply;	1
Be	1
as	1
ourself	1
in	1
Denmark.--Madam,	1
come;	1
This	1
gentle	1
and	1
unforc'd	1
accord	1
of	1
Hamlet	1
Sits	1
smiling	1
to	1
my	1
heart:[43]	1
in	1
grace	1
whereof,[44]	1
No	1

that	1
Denmark	1
drinks	1
to-day,[45]	1
But	1
the	1

O,	1
that	1

too	1
solid	1
flesh	1
would	1
melt,	1
Thaw,	1
and	1
resolve	1
itself[46]	1

Fye	1

O	1
fye!	1
'tis	1
an	1

That	1
grows	1
to	1
seed;	1
things	1
rank	1
and	1
gross	1
in	1
nature	1
Possess	1
it	1
merely.[49]	1
That	1
it	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
this!	1
But	1
two	1
months	1
dead!--nay,	1
not	1
so	1
much,	1
not	1
two:	1
So	1
excellent	1
a	1
king;	1
that	1
was,	1
to	1
this,	1
Hyperion	1
to	1
a	1
satyr:[50]	1

roughly.	1
Heaven	1

earth!	1
Must	1
I	1
remember?	1
why,	1
she	1
would	1
hang	1
on	1
him,	1
As	1
if	1
increase	1
of	1
appetite	1

grown	1
By	1
what	1

on:	1
And	1
yet,	1
within	1
a	1
month,--	1
Let	1
me	1
not	1
think	1
on't,--Frailty,	1
thy	1

Woman!--	1
A	1
little	1
month;	1
or	1
ere	1
those	1
shoes	1
were	1
old	1
With	1
which	1
she	1

with	1
my	1

My	1

no	1
more	1

_Hor._	1
(L.)	1
A	1
truant	1
disposition,	1
good	1
my	1
lord.	1
_Ham._	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
hear	1
your	1
enemy	1
say	1
so;	1
Nor	1
shall	1
you	1
do	1
mine	1
ear	1
that	1
violence,	1
To	1
make	1
it	1
truster	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
report	1
Against	1
yourself:	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
are	1
no	1
truant.	1
But	1
what	1
is	1
your	1
affair	1
in	1
Elsinore?	1
We'll	1
teach	1
you	1
to	1
drink	1
deep,	1
ere	1
you	1
depart.	1
_Hor._	1
My	1
lord,	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
your	1
father's	1
funeral.	1
_Ham._	1
I	1
pray	1
thee,	1
do	1
not	1
mock	1
me,	1
fellow-student;	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
mother's	1
wedding.	1
_Hor._	1
Indeed,	1
my	1
lord,	1
it	1
followed	1
hard	1
upon.	1
_Ham._	1
Thrift,	1
thrift,	1
Horatio!	1
the	1
funeral	1
bak'd	1
meats	1
Did	1
coldly	1
furnish	1
forth	1
the	1
marriage	1
tables.	1
Would	1
I	1
had	1
met	1
my	1
dearest	1
foe[56]	1
in	1
Heaven	1
Ere	1
ever	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
that	1
day,	1
Horatio!	1
My	1
father,--Methinks,	1
I	1
see	1
my	1
father.	1
_Hor._	1
Where,	1
My	1
lord?	1
_Ham._	1
In	1
my	1
mind's	1
eye,	1
Horatio.	1
_Hor._	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
once;	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
goodly	1
king.[57]	1
_Ham._	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
man,	1
take	1
him	1
for	1
all	1
in	1
all,	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
look	1
upon	1

again.	1
[_Crosses	1

yesternight.	1

the	1

a	1

an	1
attent	1
ear;	1
till	1
I	1
may	1
deliver,	1
Upon	1
the	1
witness	1
of	1
these	1
gentlemen,	1
This	1
marvel	1
to	1
you.	1
_Ham._	1
For	1
Heaven's	1
love,	1
let	1
me	1
hear.	1
_Hor._	1
Two	1
nights	1
together	1
had	1
these	1
gentlemen,	1
Marcellus	1
and	1
Bernardo,	1
on	1
their	1
watch,	1
In	1
the	1
dead	1
waste	1
and	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
night,[59]	1
Been	1
thus	1
encounter'd.	1
A	1
figure	1
like	1
your	1
father,	1
Arm'd	1
at	1
all	1
points	1
exactly,	1
cap-à-pé,	1
Appears	1
before	1
them,	1
and,	1
with	1
solemn	1
march	1
Goes	1
slow	1
and	1
stately	1
by	1
them:	1
thrice	1
he	1
walk'd	1
By	1
their	1
oppress'd	1
and	1
fear-surprisèd	1
eyes,	1
Within	1
his	1
truncheon's	1
length;	1
whilst	1
they,	1
distill'd	1
Almost	1
to	1
jelly	1
with	1
the	1
act	1
of	1
fear,[60]	1
Stand	1
dumb,	1
and	1
speak	1
not	1
to	1
him.	1
This	1
to	1
me	1
In	1
dreadful	1
secrecy	1
impart	1
they	1
did;	1
And	1
I	1
with	1
them	1
the	1
third	1
night	1
kept	1
the	1
watch:	1
Where,	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
deliver'd,	1
both	1
in	1
time,	1
Form	1
of	1
the	1
thing,	1
each	1
word	1
made	1
true	1
and	1
good,	1
The	1
apparition	1
comes.	1
_Ham._	1
But	1
where	1
was	1
this?	1
[_Crosses	1

MARCELLUS.]	1
_Mar._	1
(R.)	1
My	1
lord,	1
upon	1
the	1
platform	1
where	1
we	1
watch'd.	1
_Ham._	1
(C.)	1
Did	1
you	1
not	1
speak	1
to	1
it?	1
_Hor._	1
(L.)	1
My	1
lord,	1
I	1
did;	1
But	1
answer	1
made	1
it	1
none:	1
yet	1
once	1
methought	1
It	1
lifted	1
up	1
its	1
head,	1
and	1
did	1
address[61]	1
Itself	1
to	1
motion,	1
like	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
speak:	1
But,	1
even	1
then,	1
the	1
morning	1
cock	1
crew	1
loud,	1
And	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
it	1
shrunk	1
in	1
haste	1
away;	1
And	1
vanish'd	1
from	1
our	1
sight.	1
_Ham._	1
'Tis	1
very	1
strange.	1
_Hor._	1
As	1
I	1
do	1
live,	1
my	1
honour'd	1
lord,	1
'tis	1
true;	1
And	1
we	1
did	1
think	1
it	1
writ	1
down[62]	1
in	1
our	1
duty	1
To	1
let	1
you	1
know	1
of	1
it.	1
_Ham._	1
Indeed,	1
indeed,	1
sirs,	1
but	1
this	1
troubles	1
me.	1
Hold	1
you	1
the	1
watch	1
to-night?	1
_Mar._	1
We	1
do,	1
my	1
lord.	1
_Ham._	1
Arm'd,	1
say	1
you?	1
_Mar._	1
Arm'd,	1
my	1
lord.	1
_Ham._	1
From	1
top	1
to	1
toe?	1
_Mar._	1
My	1
lord,	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
foot.	1
_Ham._	1
Then	1
saw	1
you	1
not	1
His	1
face?	1
_Hor._	1
O,	1
yes,	1
my	1
lord;	1
he	1
wore	1
his	1
beaver	1
up.[63]	1
_Ham._	1
What,	1
looked	1
he	1
frowningly?	1
_Hor._	1
A	1
countenance	1
more	1
In	1
sorrow	1
than	1
in	1
anger.	1
_Ham._	1
Pale	1
or	1
red?	1
_Hor._	1
Nay,	1
very	1
pale.	1
_Ham._	1
And	1
fix'd	1
his	1
eyes	1
upon	1
you?	1
_Hor._	1
Most	1
constantly.	1
_Ham._	1
I	1
would	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
there.	1
_Hor._	1
It	1
would	1
have	1
much	1
amaz'd	1
you.	1
_Ham._	1
Very	1
like,	1
Very	1
like.	1
Stay'd	1
it	1
long?	1
_Hor._	1
While	1
one	1
with	1
moderate	1
haste	1
might	1
tell	1
a	1
hundred.	1
_Mar._}	1

Longer,	1
Longer.	1
_Ber._}	1
_Hor._	1
Not	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
it.	1
_Ham._	1
His	1
beard	1
was	1
grizzl'd,	1
No?	1
_Hor._	1
It	1
was,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
life,	1
A	1
sable	1
silver'd.	1
_Ham._	1
I	1
will	1
watch	1
to-night;	1
Perchance,	1
'twill	1
walk	1
again.	1
_Hor._	1
(C.)	1
I	1
warrant	1
it	1
will.	1
_Ham._	1
If	1
it	1
assume	1
my	1
noble	1
father's	1
person,	1
I'll	1
speak	1
to	1
it,	1
though	1
hell	1
itself	1
should	1
gape,	1
And	1
bid	1
me	1
hold	1
my	1
peace.	1
[_Crosses	1

I	1
pray	1
you	1
all,	1
If	1
you	1
have	1
hitherto	1
conceal'd	1
this	1
sight,	1
Let	1
it	1
be	1
tenable[64]	1
in	1
your	1
silence	1
still;	1
And	1
whatsoever	1
else	1
shall	1
hap	1
to-night,	1
Give	1
it	1
an	1
understanding,	1
but	1
no	1
tongue;	1
I	1
will	1
requite	1
your	1
loves.	1
So,	1
fare	1
you	1
well:	1
Upon	1
the	1
platform,	1
'twixt	1
eleven	1
and	1
twelve,	1
I'll	1

And,	1

Let	1
me	1

from	1

_Oph._	1

Do	1
you	1
doubt	1
that?	1
_Laer._	1
For	1
Hamlet,	1
and	1
the	1
trifling	1
of	1
his	1
favour,[66]	1
Hold	1
it	1
a	1
fashion,	1
and	1
a	1
toy	1
in	1
blood;	1
A	1
violet	1
in	1
the	1
youth	1
of	1
primy	1
nature,	1
Forward,	1
not	1
permanent,	1
sweet,	1
not	1
lasting,	1
The	1
pérfume	1
and	1
suppliance	1
of	1
a	1
minute.[67]	1
_Oph._	1
No	1
more	1
but	1
so?	1
_Laer._	1
He	1
may	1
not,	1
as	1
unvalued	1
persons	1
do,	1
Carve	1
for	1
himself;	1
for	1
on	1
his	1
choice	1
depends	1
The	1
safety	1
and	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
state.	1
Then	1
weigh	1
what	1
loss	1
your	1
honour	1
may	1
sustain,	1
If	1
with	1
too	1
credent	1
ear	1
you	1
list	1
his	1
songs.	1
Fear	1
it,	1
Ophelia,	1
fear	1
it,	1
my	1
dear	1
sister;	1
And	1
keep	1
within	1
the	1
rear	1
of	1
your	1
affection,[68]	1
Out	1
of	1
the	1
shot	1
and	1
danger	1
of	1
desire.	1
The	1
chariest	1
maid[69]	1
is	1
prodigal	1
enough,	1
If	1
she	1
unmask	1
her	1
beauty	1
to	1
the	1
moon:	1
Virtue	1
itself	1
scapes	1
not	1
calumnious	1
strokes:	1
Be	1
wary,	1
then;	1
best	1
safety	1
lies	1
in	1
fear:	1
Youth	1

itself	1
rebels,	1

none	1
else	1
near.	1
_Oph._	1
I	1
shall	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
this	1
good	1
lesson	1
keep,	1
As	1
watchman	1

my	1
heart.	1
But,	1
good	1
my	1
brother,	1
Do	1
not,	1
as	1
some	1
ungracious	1
pastors	1
do,	1
Show	1
me	1
the	1
steep	1
and	1
thorny	1
way	1
to	1
heaven	1
Whilst,	1
like	1
a	1
puff'd	1
and	1
reckless	1
libertine,[70]	1
Himself	1
the	1
primrose	1
path	1
of	1
dalliance	1
treads,	1
And	1
recks	1
not	1
his	1
own	1
read.[71]	1
_Laer._	1
O,	1
fear	1
me	1
not.	1
I	1
stay	1
too	1

POLONIUS	1

_Pol._	1
Yet	1

Laertes!	1

shame!	1
The	1

sits	1
in	1
the	1
shoulder	1
of	1
your	1
sail,[72]	1
And	1
you	1
are	1
staid	1
for.	1
There,--my	1
blessing	1
with	1
you!	1
[_Laying	1
his	1
hand	1
on_	1
LAERTES'	1
_head_.]	1
And	1
these	1
few	1
precepts	1
in	1
thy	1
memory--	1
Look	1
thou	1
charácter.[73]	1
Give	1
thy	1
thoughts	1
no	1
tongue,	1
Nor	1
any	1
unproportion'd	1
thought[74]	1
his	1
act.	1
Be	1
thou	1
familiar,	1
but	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
vulgar.	1
The	1
friends	1
thou	1
hast,	1
and	1
their	1
adoption	1
tried,	1
Grapple	1
them	1
to	1
thy	1
soul	1
with	1
hooks	1
of	1
steel;	1
But	1
do	1
not	1
dull	1
thy	1
palm	1
with	1
entertainment	1
Of	1
each	1
new-hatch'd,	1
unfledg'd	1
comrade.	1
Beware	1
Of	1
entrance	1
to	1
a	1
quarrel;	1
but	1
being	1
in,	1
Bear	1
it,	1
that	1
the	1
opposer	1
may	1
beware	1
of	1
thee.	1
Give	1
every	1
man	1
thine	1
ear,	1
but	1
few	1
thy	1
voice:	1
Take	1
each	1
man's	1
censure,[75]	1
but	1
reserve	1
thy	1
judgment.	1
Costly	1
thy	1
habit	1
as	1
thy	1
purse	1
can	1
buy,	1
But	1
not	1
express'd	1
in	1
fancy;	1
rich,	1
not	1
gaudy:	1
For	1
the	1
apparel	1
oft	1
proclaims	1
the	1
man;	1
And	1
they	1
in	1
France	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
rank	1
and	1
station	1
Are	1
most	1
select	1
and	1
generous,	1
chief	1
in	1
that.[76]	1
Neither	1
a	1
borrower	1
nor	1
a	1
lender	1
be:	1
For	1
loan	1
oft	1
loses	1
both	1
itself	1
and	1
friend;	1
And	1
borrowing	1
dulls	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
husbandry.[77]	1
This	1
above	1
all,--To	1
thine	1
ownself	1
be	1
true;	1
And	1
it	1
must	1
follow,	1
as	1
the	1
night	1
the	1
day,	1
Thou	1
canst	1
not	1
then	1
be	1
false	1
to	1
any	1
man.	1
Farewell;	1
my	1
blessing	1
season	1
this	1
in	1
thee![78]	1
_Laer._	1
Most	1
humbly	1
do	1
I	1
take	1
my	1
leave,	1
my	1
lord.	1
[_Crosses	1

bounteous:	1
If	1

(as	1
so	1
'tis	1
put	1

me,[81]	1
And	1

I	1
must	1

you,	1
You	1
do	1
not	1

yourself	1
so	1
clearly	1
As	1
it	1
behoves	1
my	1
daughter,	1
and	1
your	1

What	1
is	1
between[82]	1
you?	1
give	1
me	1
up	1
the	1
truth.	1
_Oph._	1
He	1
hath,	1
my	1
lord,	1
of	1
late,	1
made	1
many	1
tenders	1
Of	1
his	1
affection	1
to	1
me.	1
_Pol._	1
Affection!	1
pooh!	1
you	1
speak	1
like	1
a	1
green	1
girl,	1
Unsifted[83]	1
in	1
such	1
perilous	1
circumstance.	1
Do	1
you	1
believe	1
his	1
tenders,	1
as	1
you	1
call	1
them?	1
_Oph._	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know,	1
my	1
lord,	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
think.	1
_Pol._	1
Marry,	1
I'll	1
teach	1
you:	1
think	1
yourself	1
a	1
baby;	1
That	1
you	1
have	1
ta'en	1
these	1
tenders	1
for	1
true	1
pay,	1
Which	1
are	1
not	1
sterling.	1
Tender	1
yourself	1
more	1
dearly;	1
Or,	1
you'll	1
tender	1
me	1
a	1
fool.	1
_Oph._	1
My	1
lord,	1
he	1
hath	1
impórtun'd	1
me	1
with	1
love	1
In	1
honourable	1
fashion.	1
_Pol._	1
Ay,	1
fashion	1
you	1
may	1
call	1
it;	1
go	1
to,	1
go	1
to.	1
_Oph._	1
And	1
hath	1
given	1
countenance	1
to	1
his	1
speech,	1
my	1
lord,	1
With	1
almost	1
all	1
the	1
holy	1
vows	1

Ay,	1

from	1

Have	1
you	1

Indeed?	1

to	1
my	1

thee--Hamlet,	1

Royal	1

O,	1
answer	1
me!	1
Let	1
me	1
not	1
burst	1
in	1
ignorance;	1
but	1
tell	1
Why	1
thy	1
canoniz'd	1
bones,	1
hearsed	1
in	1
death,[90]	1
Have	1
burst	1
their	1
cerements;[91]	1
why	1
the	1
sepulchre,	1
Wherein	1
we	1
saw	1
thee	1
quietly	1
in-urn'd,	1
Hath	1
op'd	1
his	1
ponderous	1
and	1
marble	1
jaws,	1
To	1
cast	1
thee	1
up	1
again!	1
What	1
may	1
this	1
mean,	1
That	1
thou,	1
dead	1
corse,	1
again,	1
in	1
cómplete	1
steel,	1
Revisits	1
thus	1
the	1
glimpses	1
of	1
the	1
moon,	1
Making	1
night	1
hideous;	1
and	1
we	1
fools	1
of	1
nature[92]	1
So	1
horridly	1
to	1
shake	1
our	1
disposition[93]	1
With	1
thoughts	1
beyond	1
the	1
reaches	1
of	1
our	1
souls?	1
Say,	1
why	1
is	1
this?	1
wherefore?	1
what	1
should	1
we	1
do?	1
[Ghost	1
_beckons._]	1
_Hor._	1
It	1
beckons	1
you	1
to	1
go	1
away	1
with	1
it,	1
As	1
if	1

do	1

with	1

No,	1
by	1
no	1

_Ham._	1

will	1

_Hor._	1
Do	1
not,	1
my	1

_Ham._	1
Why,	1
what	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
fear?	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
set	1
my	1
life	1
at	1
a	1
pin's	1
fee;[95]	1
And	1
for	1
my	1
soul,	1
what	1
can	1
it	1
do	1
to	1
that,	1
Being	1
a	1
thing	1
immortal	1
as	1
itself?	1
[Ghost	1
_beckons._]	1
It	1
waves	1
me	1
forth	1
again;--I'll	1
follow	1
it.	1
_Hor._	1
What	1
if	1
it	1
tempt	1
you	1
toward	1
the	1
flood,	1
my	1
lord,[96]	1
Or	1
to	1
the	1
dreadful	1
summit	1
of	1
the	1
cliff	1
That	1
beetles	1
o'er	1
his	1

into	1
the	1
sea,[97]	1
And	1
there	1
assume	1
some	1
other	1
horrible	1
form,	1
And	1
draw	1
you	1
into	1
madness?	1
[Ghost	1
_beckons._]	1
_Ham._	1
It	1
waves	1
me	1
still.--	1
Go	1
on;	1
I'll	1
follow	1
thee.	1
_Mar._	1
You	1
shall	1
not	1

Hold	1

_Hor._	1
Be	1
rul'd;	1
you	1
shall	1
not	1
go.	1
_Ham._	1
My	1
fate	1
cries	1
out,	1
And	1
makes	1
each	1
petty	1
artery	1
in	1
this	1
body	1
As	1
hardy	1
as	1
the	1
Némean	1
lion's	1
nerve.[98]	1
[Ghost	1

Still	1
am	1

me,	1

[_Breaking	1

By	1

When	1
I	1

sulphurous	1

thou	1

_Ham._	1
What?	1
_Ghost._	1
I	1
am	1
thy	1
father's	1
spirit;	1
Doom'd	1
for	1
a	1
certain	1
term	1
to	1
walk	1
the	1
night,	1
And	1
for	1
the	1
day	1
confin'd	1
to	1
fast	1
in	1
fires,[100]	1
Till	1
the	1
foul	1
crimes	1
done	1
in	1
my	1
days	1
of	1
nature	1
Are	1
burnt	1
and	1
purg'd	1

But	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
forbid	1
To	1
tell	1
the	1
secrets	1
of	1
my	1
prison-house,	1
I	1
could	1
a	1
tale	1
unfold,	1
whose	1
lightest	1
word	1
Would	1
harrow	1
up	1
thy	1
soul;[101]	1
freeze	1
thy	1
young	1
blood;	1
Make	1
thy	1
two	1
eyes,	1
like	1
stars,	1
start	1
from	1
their	1
spheres;	1
Thy	1
knotted	1
and	1
combinèd	1
locks	1
to	1
part,	1
And	1
each	1
particular	1
hair	1
to	1
stand	1
on	1
end,[102]	1
Like	1
quills	1
upon	1
the	1
fretful	1
porcupine:[103]	1
But	1
this	1
eternal	1
blazon[104]	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
To	1
ears	1
of	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood.--List,	1
list,	1
O,	1
list!--	1
If	1
thou	1
didst	1
ever	1
thy	1
dear	1
father	1
love,----	1
_Ham._	1
O	1
Heaven!	1
_Ghost._	1
Revenge	1
his	1
foul	1

most	1
unnatural	1
murder.	1
_Ham._	1
Murder!	1
_Ghost._	1
Murder	1
most	1
foul,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
it	1
is;	1
But	1
this	1
most	1
foul,	1
strange,	1
and	1
unnatural.	1
_Ham._	1
Haste	1
me	1
to	1
know	1
it,	1
that	1
I,	1
with	1
wings	1
as	1
swift	1
As	1
meditation	1
or	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
love,	1
May	1
sweep	1
to	1
my	1
revenge.	1
_Ghost._	1
I	1
find	1
thee	1
apt;	1
And	1
duller	1
shouldst	1
thou	1
be	1
than	1
the	1
fat	1
weed	1
That	1
rots	1
itself	1
in	1
ease	1
on	1
Lethe	1
wharf,[105]	1
Wouldst	1
thou	1
not	1
stir	1
in	1
this.	1
Now,	1
Hamlet,	1
hear:	1
'Tis	1
given	1
out	1
that,	1
sleeping	1
in	1
mine	1
orchard,[106]	1
A	1
serpent	1
stung	1
me;	1
so	1
the	1
whole	1
ear	1
of	1
Denmark	1
Is	1
by	1
a	1
forged	1
process[107]	1
of	1
my	1
death	1
Rankly	1
abus'd:	1
but	1
know,	1
thou	1
noble	1
youth,	1
The	1
serpent	1
that	1
did	1
sting	1
thy	1
father's	1
life	1
Now	1
wears	1
his	1
crown.	1
_Ham._	1
O,	1
my	1
prophetic	1
soul!	1
my	1
uncle!	1
_Ghost._	1
Ay,	1
that	1
incestuous,	1
that	1
adulterate	1
beast,	1
With	1
witchcraft	1
of	1
his	1
wit,	1
with	1
traitorous	1
gifts,	1
Won	1
to	1
his	1
shameful	1
lust	1
The	1
will	1
of	1
my	1
most	1
seeming	1
virtuous	1
queen:	1
O,	1
Hamlet,	1
what	1
a	1
falling-off	1
was	1
there!	1
From	1
me,	1
whose	1
love	1
was	1
of	1
that	1
dignity,	1
That	1
it	1
went	1
hand	1
in	1
hand	1
even	1
with	1
the	1
vow	1
I	1
made	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
marriage;	1
and	1
to	1
decline	1
Upon	1
a	1
wretch,[108]	1
whose	1
natural	1
gifts	1
were	1
poor	1
To	1
those	1
of	1
mine!	1
But,	1
soft!	1
methinks	1
I	1
scent	1
the	1
morning	1
air;	1
Brief	1
let	1
me	1
be.--Sleeping	1
within	1
mine	1
orchard,	1
My	1
custom	1
always	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon,	1
Upon	1
my	1
secure[109]	1
hour	1
thy	1
uncle	1
stole,	1
With	1
juice	1
of	1
cursed	1
hebenon[110]	1
in	1
a	1
vial,	1
And	1
in	1
the	1
porches	1
of	1
mine	1
ears	1
did	1
pour	1
The	1
leperous	1
distilment;	1
whose	1
effect	1
Holds	1
such	1
an	1
enmity	1
with	1
blood	1
of	1
man,	1
That,	1
swift	1
as	1
quicksilver,	1
it	1
courses	1
through	1
The	1
natural	1
gates	1
and	1
alleys	1
of	1
the	1
body;	1
So	1
did	1
it	1
mine;	1
Thus	1
was	1
I,	1
sleeping,	1
by	1
a	1
brother's	1
hand	1
Of	1
life,	1
of	1
crown,	1
of	1
queen,	1
at	1
once	1
despatch'd:[111]	1
Cut	1
off	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
blossoms	1
of	1
my	1
sin,	1
Unhousel'd,	1
disappointed,	1
unanel'd;[112]	1
No	1
reckoning	1
made,	1
but	1
sent	1
to	1
my	1
account	1
With	1
all	1
my	1
imperfections	1
on	1
my	1
head.	1
_Ham._	1
O,	1
horrible!	1
O,	1
horrible!	1
most	1
horrible!	1
_Ghost._	1
If	1
thou	1
hast	1
nature	1
in	1
thee,	1
bear	1
it	1
not;	1
Let	1
not	1
the	1
royal	1
bed	1
of	1
Denmark	1
be	1
A	1
couch	1
for	1
luxury[113]	1
and	1
damnèd	1
incest.	1
But,	1
howsoever	1
thou	1
pursu'st	1
this	1
act,	1
Taint	1
not	1
thy	1
mind,	1
nor	1
let	1
thy	1
soul	1
contrive	1
Against	1
thy	1
mother	1
aught:	1
leave	1
her	1
to	1
Heaven,	1
And	1
to	1
those	1
thorns	1
that	1
in	1
her	1
bosom	1
lodge,	1
To	1
prick	1
and	1
sting	1
her.	1
Fare	1
thee	1
well	1
at	1
once!	1
The	1
glow-worm	1
shows	1
the	1
matin	1
to	1
be	1
near,	1
And	1
'gins	1
to	1
pale	1
his	1
ineffectual	1
fire:[114]	1
Adieu,	1
adieu,	1
adieu!	1
remember	1
me.	1

tell	1

this.	1

right;	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
right;	1
And	1
so,	1
without	1
more	1
circumstance	1
at	1
all,	1
I	1
hold	1
it	1
fit	1
that	1
we	1
shake	1
hands,	1
and	1
part:	1
You	1
as	1
your	1
business	1
and	1
desire	1
shall	1
point	1
you,	1
For	1
every	1
man	1
hath	1
business	1
and	1
desire,	1
Such	1
as	1
it	1
is;--and,	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
poor	1
part,	1
Look	1
you,	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
pray.	1
_Hor._	1
These	1
are	1
but	1
wild	1
and	1
whirling	1
words,[119]	1
my	1
lord.	1
_Ham._	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
they	1
offend	1
you,	1
heartily.	1

There's	1
no	1
offence,	1
my	1

Yes,	1

Saint	1

there	1
is,	1
Horatio,	1
And	1

[Footnote	1
I.31:	1
_A	1
little	1
more	1
than	1
kin,	1
and	1
less	1
than	1
kind._]	1
Dr.	1
Johnson	1
says	1
that	1
_kind_	1
is	1
the	1
Teutonic	1
word	1
for	1
_child_.	1
Hamlet,	1
therefore,	1
answers	1
to	1
the	1
titles	1
of	1
_cousin_	1
and	1
_son_,	1
which	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
given	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
somewhat	1
more	1
than	1
_cousin_,	1
and	1
less	1
than	1
_son_.	1
Steevens	1
remarks,	1
that	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
another	1
proverbial	1
phrase:	1
"The	1
nearer	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
blood,	1
the	1
further	1
we	1
must	1
be	1
from	1
love;	1
the	1
greater	1
the	1
_kindred_	1
is,	1
the	1
less	1
the	1
_kindness_	1
must	1
be."	1
_Kin_	1
is	1
still	1
used	1
in	1
the	1
Midland	1
Counties	1
for	1
_cousin_,	1
and	1
_kind_	1
signifies	1
_nature_.	1
Hamlet	1
may,	1
therefore,	1
mean	1
that	1
the	1
relationship	1
between	1
them	1
had	1
become	1
_unnatural_.]	1
[Footnote	1
I.32:	1
_I	1
am	1
too	1
much	1
i'the	1
sun._]	1
Meaning,	1
probably,	1
his	1
being	1
sent	1
for	1
from	1
his	1
studies	1
to	1
be	1
exposed	1
at	1
his	1
uncle's	1
marriage	1
as	1
his	1
_chiefest	1
courtier_,	1
and	1
being	1
thereby	1
placed	1
too	1
much	1
in	1
the	1
radiance	1
of	1
the	1
king's	1
presence;	1
or,	1
perhaps,	1
an	1
allusion	1
to	1
the	1
proverb,	1
"_Out	1
of	1
Heaven's	1
blessing,	1
into	1
the	1
warm	1
sun:_"	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
unlikely	1
that	1
a	1
quibble	1
is	1
meant	1
between	1
_son_	1
and	1
_sun_.]	1

_No	1

Dr.	1
Johnson	1
remarks,	1
that	1
the	1
king's	1
intemperance	1
is	1
very	1
strongly	1
impressed;	1
everything	1
that	1
happens	1
to	1
him	1
gives	1
him	1
occasion	1
to	1
drink.	1
The	1
Danes	1
were	1

to	1
be	1
hard	1
drinkers.]	1

HOUSE.	1
_Enter_	1
POLONIUS[1]	1
(L.H.),	1
_meeting	1
Ophelia._	1
(R.H.)	1
_Pol._	1
How	1
now,	1
Ophelia!	1
What's	1
the	1
matter?	1
_Oph._	1
O,	1
my	1
lord,	1
my	1
lord,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
affrighted!	1
_Pol._	1
With	1
what,	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Heaven?	1
_Oph._	1
My	1
lord,	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
sewing	1
in	1
my	1
closet,	1
Lord	1
Hamlet,	1
with	1
his	1
doublet	1
all	1
unbrac'd;	1
Pale	1
as	1
his	1
shirt;	1
his	1
knees	1
knocking	1
each	1
other,	1
And	1
with	1
a	1
look	1
so	1
piteous	1
in	1
purport,	1
He	1
comes	1
before	1
me.	1
_Pol._	1
Mad	1
for	1
thy	1
love?	1
_Oph._	1
My	1
lord,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know;	1
But,	1
truly,	1
I	1
do	1
fear	1
it.	1
_Pol._	1
What	1
said	1
he?	1
_Oph._	1
He	1
took	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
wrist,	1
and	1
held	1
me	1
hard;	1
Then	1
goes	1
he	1
to	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
arm;	1
And,	1
with	1
his	1
other	1
hand	1
thus	1
o'er	1
his	1
brow,	1
He	1
falls	1
to	1
such	1
perusal	1
of	1
my	1
face	1
As	1
he	1
would	1
draw	1
it.	1
Long	1
staid	1
he	1
so;	1
At	1
last,--a	1
little	1
shaking	1
of	1
mine	1
arm,	1
And	1
thrice	1
his	1
head	1
thus	1
waving	1
up	1
and	1
down,	1
He	1
rais'd	1
a	1
sigh	1
so	1
piteous	1
and	1
profound,	1
As	1
it	1
did	1
seem	1
to	1
shatter	1
all	1
his	1
bulk,[2]	1
And	1
end	1
his	1
being:	1
That	1
done,	1
he	1
lets	1
me	1
go:	1
And,	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder	1
turn'd,	1
He	1
seem'd	1
to	1
find	1
his	1
way	1
without	1
his	1
eyes;	1
For	1
out	1
o'doors	1
he	1
went	1
without	1
their	1
helps,	1
And,	1
to	1
the	1
last,	1
bended	1
their	1
light	1
on	1
me.	1
_Pol._	1
Come,	1
go	1
with	1
me;	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
seek	1
the	1
king.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
ecstacy	1
of	1
love;[3]	1
What,	1
have	1
you	1
given	1
him	1
any	1
hard	1
words	1
of	1
late?	1
_Oph._	1
No,	1
my	1
good	1
lord;	1
but,	1
as	1
you	1
did	1
command,	1
I	1
did	1
repel	1
his	1
letters,	1
and	1
denied	1
His	1
access	1
to	1
me.	1
_Pol._	1
That	1
hath	1
made	1
him	1
mad.	1
Come,	1
go	1
we	1
to	1
the	1
king:	1
This	1
must	1
be	1
known;	1
which,	1
being	1
kept	1
close,	1
might	1
move	1
More	1
grief	1
to	1
hide	1
than	1
hate	1
to	1
utter	1
love.[4]	1
Come.	1

KING,	1
QUEEN,	1
ROSENCRANTZ,	1
GUILDENSTERN,	1

Attendants	1
(R.H.)	1
_King._	1
(C.)	1
Welcome,	1
dear	1
Rosencrantz	1
and	1
Guildenstern!	1
Moreover	1
that	1
we	1
much	1
did	1
long	1
to	1
see	1
you,	1
The	1
need	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
use	1
you	1
did	1
provoke	1
Our	1
hasty	1
sending.	1
Something	1
have	1
you	1
heard	1
Of	1
Hamlet's	1
transformation.	1
What	1
it	1
should	1
be,	1
More	1
than	1
his	1
father's	1
death,	1
that	1
thus	1
hath	1
put	1
him	1
So	1
much	1
from	1
the	1
understanding	1
of	1
himself,[5]	1
I	1
cannot	1
dream	1
of:	1
I	1
entreat	1
you	1
both,	1
That	1
you	1
vouchsafe	1
your	1
rest[6]	1
here	1
in	1
our	1
court	1
Some	1
little	1
time:	1
so	1
by	1
your	1
companies	1
To	1
draw	1
him	1
on	1
to	1
pleasures,	1
and	1
to	1
gather,	1
Whether	1
aught,	1
to	1
us	1
unknown,	1
afflicts	1
him	1
thus,	1
That,	1
open'd,	1
lies	1
within	1
our	1
remedy.	1
_Queen._	1
(R.C.)	1
Good	1
gentlemen,	1
he	1
hath	1
much	1
talk'd	1
of	1
you;	1
And	1
sure	1
I	1
am	1
two	1
men	1
there	1
are	1
not	1
living	1
To	1
whom	1
he	1
more	1
adheres.	1
If	1
it	1
will	1
please	1
you	1
So	1
to	1
expend	1
your	1
time	1
with	1
us	1
a	1
while,	1
Your	1
visitation	1
shall	1
receive	1
such	1
thanks	1
As	1
fits	1
a	1
king's	1
remembrance.	1
_Ros._	1
(R.)	1
Both	1
your	1
majesties	1
Might,	1
by	1
the	1
sovereign	1
power	1
you	1
have	1
of	1
us,[7]	1
Put	1
your	1
dread	1
pleasures	1
more	1
into	1
command	1
Than	1
to	1
entreaty.	1
_Guil._	1
(R.)	1
But	1
we	1
both	1
obey,	1
And	1
here	1
give	1
up	1
ourselves,	1
in	1
the	1
full	1
bent,[8]	1
To	1
lay	1
our	1
service	1
freely	1
at	1
your	1
feet.	1
_King._	1
Thanks,	1
Rosencrantz	1
and	1
gentle	1
Guildenstern.	1
_Queen._	1
I	1
do	1
beseech	1
you	1
instantly	1
to	1
visit	1
My	1
too	1
much	1
changèd	1
son.	1
Go,	1
some	1
of	1
you,	1
And	1
bring	1
these	1
gentlemen	1
where	1
Hamlet	1
is.	1

_Pol._	1
Now	1
do	1
I	1
think	1
(or	1
else	1
this	1
brain	1
of	1
mine	1
Hunts	1
not	1
the	1
trail	1
of	1
policy[9]	1
so	1
sure	1
As	1
it	1
hath	1
us'd	1
to	1
do),	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
The	1
very	1
cause	1
of	1
Hamlet's	1
lunacy.	1
_King._	1
(C.)	1
O,	1
speak	1
of	1
that;	1
that	1
do	1
I	1
long	1
to	1
hear.	1
_Pol._	1
(L.C.)	1
My	1
liege,	1
and	1
madam,	1
to	1
expostulate[10]	1
What	1
majesty	1
should	1
be,	1
what	1
duty	1
is,	1
Why	1
day	1
is	1
day,	1
night	1
night,	1
and	1
time	1
is	1
time,	1
Were	1
nothing	1
but	1
to	1
waste	1
night,	1
day,	1
and	1
time;	1
Therefore,	1
since	1
brevity	1
is	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
wit,	1
And	1
tediousness	1
the	1
limbs	1
and	1
outward	1
flourishes,--	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
brief:--Your	1
noble	1
son	1
is	1
mad:	1
Mad	1
call	1
I	1
it;	1
for,	1
to	1
define	1
true	1
madness,	1
What	1
is't,	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
nothing	1
else	1
but	1
mad?	1
But	1
let	1
that	1
go.	1
_Queen._	1
(R.C.)	1
More	1
matter,	1
with	1
less	1
art.	1
_Pol._	1
Madam,	1
I	1
swear	1
I	1
use	1
no	1
art	1
at	1
all.	1
That	1
he	1
is	1
mad,	1
'tis	1
true:	1
'tis	1
true	1
'tis	1
pity;	1
And	1
pity	1
'tis,	1
'tis	1
true:	1
a	1
foolish	1
figure;	1
But	1
farewell	1
it,	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
use	1
no	1
art.	1
Mad	1
let	1
us	1
grant	1
him,	1
then:	1
and	1
now	1
remains	1
That	1
we	1
find	1
out	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
this	1
effect,	1
Or,	1
rather	1
say,	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
this	1
defect,	1
For	1
this	1
effect	1
defective	1
comes	1
by	1
cause:	1
Thus	1
it	1
remains,	1
and	1
the	1
remainder	1
thus,	1
Perpend.[11]	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
daughter,	1
have,	1
while	1
she	1
is	1
mine,	1
Who,	1
in	1
her	1
duty	1
and	1
obedience,	1
mark,	1
Hath	1
given	1
me	1
this:	1
Now	1
gather,	1
and	1
surmise.	1
[Reads]	1
_To	1
the	1
celestial,	1
and	1
my	1
soul's	1
idol,	1
the	1
most	1
beautified	1
Ophelia,--_[12]	1
That's	1
an	1
ill	1
phrase,	1
a	1
vile	1
phrase,	1
_beautified_	1
is	1
a	1
vile	1
phrase:	1
but	1
you	1
shall	1
hear.	1
Thus:	1
_In	1
her	1
excellent	1
white	1
bosom,[13]	1
these_,	1
&c.[14]	1
_Queen._	1
Came	1
this	1
from	1
Hamlet	1
to	1
her?	1
_Pol._	1
Good	1
madam,	1
stay	1
awhile;	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
faithful.--	1
[_Reads._]	1
_Doubt	1
thou	1
the	1

_Doubt	1
thou	1

_Doubt	1

_But	1
never	1

_O	1
dear	1
Ophelia,	1
I	1
am	1
ill	1
at	1
these	1
numbers;[15]	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
art	1
to	1
reckon	1
my	1
groans:	1
but	1
that	1
I	1
love	1

O	1

Adieu._	1
_Thine	1
evermore,	1
most	1
dear	1
lady,	1
whilst	1
this	1
machine	1
is	1
to	1
him_,[17]	1
Hamlet.	1
This,	1
in	1
obedience,	1
hath	1
my	1
daughter	1
shown	1
me:	1
And	1
more	1
above,[18]	1
hath	1
his	1
solicitings,[19]	1
As	1
they	1
fell	1
out	1
by	1
time,	1
by	1
means,	1
and	1
place,	1
All	1
given	1
to	1
my	1
ear.	1
_King._	1
But	1
how	1
hath	1
she	1
Receiv'd	1
his	1
love?	1
_Pol._	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
of	1
me?	1
_King._	1
As	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
faithful	1
and	1
honourable.	1
_Pol._	1
I	1
would	1
fain	1
prove	1
so.	1
But	1
what	1
might	1
you	1
think,	1
When	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
this	1
hot	1
love	1
on	1
the	1
wing	1
(As	1
I	1
perceived	1
it,	1
I	1
must	1
tell	1
you	1
that,	1
Before	1
my	1
daughter	1
told	1
me),	1
what	1
might	1
you,	1
Or	1
my	1
dear	1
majesty	1
your	1
queen	1
here,	1
think,	1
If	1
I	1
had	1
play'd	1
the	1
desk	1
or	1
table	1
book;[20]	1
Or	1
given	1
my	1
heart	1
a	1
winking,	1
mute	1
and	1
dumb;[21]	1
Or	1
look'd	1
upon	1
this	1
love	1
with	1
idle	1
sight;[22]	1
What	1
might	1
you	1
think?	1
No,	1
I	1
went	1
round	1
to	1
work,[23]	1
And	1
my	1
young	1
mistress	1
thus	1
did	1
I	1
bespeak:	1
_Lord	1
Hamlet	1
is	1
a	1
prince,	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
sphere;	1
This	1
must	1
not	1
be:_	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
precepts	1
gave	1
her,	1
That	1
she	1
should	1
lock	1
herself	1
from	1
his	1
resort,	1
Admit	1
no	1
messengers,	1
receive	1
no	1
tokens.	1
Which	1
done,	1
she	1
took	1
the	1
fruits	1
of	1
my	1
advice;[24]	1
And	1
he,	1
repuls'd	1
(a	1
short	1
tale	1
to	1
make),	1
Fell	1
into	1
sadness;	1
thence	1
into	1
a	1
weakness;	1
Thence	1
to	1
a	1
lightness;	1
and,	1
by	1
this	1
declension,	1
Into	1
the	1
madness	1
wherein	1
now	1
he	1
raves,	1
And	1
all	1
we	1
mourn	1
for.	1
_King._	1
Do	1
you	1
think	1
'tis	1
this?	1
_Queen._	1
It	1
may	1
be,	1
very	1
likely.	1
_Pol._	1
Hath	1
there	1
been	1
such	1
a	1
time	1
(I'd	1
fain	1
know	1
that,)	1
That	1
I	1
have	1
positively	1
said,	1
_'tis	1
so_,	1
When	1
it	1
proved	1
otherwise?	1
_King._	1
Not	1
that	1
I	1
know.	1
_Pol._	1
Take	1
this	1
from	1
this,	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
otherwise:	1
[_Pointing	1
to	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
shoulder._]	1
If	1
circumstances	1
lead	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
find	1
Where	1
truth	1
is	1
hid,	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
hid	1
indeed	1
Within	1
the	1
centre.	1
_King._	1
How	1
may	1
we	1
try	1
it	1
further?	1
_Pol._	1
You	1
know,	1
sometimes	1
he	1
walks	1
for	1
hours	1
together	1
Here	1
in	1
the	1
lobby.	1
_Queen._	1
So	1
he	1
does,	1
indeed.	1
_Pol._	1
At	1
such	1
a	1
time	1
I'll	1
loose	1
my	1
daughter	1
to	1
him:	1
Mark	1
the	1
encounter:	1
if	1
he	1
love	1
her	1
not,	1
And	1
be	1
not	1
from	1
his	1
reason	1
fallen	1
thereon,	1
Let	1
me	1
be	1
no	1
assistant	1
for	1
a	1
state,	1
But	1
keep	1
a	1
farm,	1
and	1
carters.	1
_King._	1
We	1
will	1
try	1
it.	1
_Queen._	1
But,	1
look,	1
where	1
sadly	1
the	1
poor	1
wretch	1
comes	1
reading.	1
_Pol._	1
Away,	1
I	1
do	1
beseech	1
you	1
both,	1
away:	1
I'll	1
board	1
him	1
presently.[25]	1

_Enter_	1
HAMLET,	1

(L.C.)	1
_Pol._	1
How	1
does	1
my	1
good	1
lord	1
Hamlet?	1
_Ham._	1
(C.)	1
Excellent	1
well.	1
_Pol._	1
(R.)	1
Do	1
you	1
know	1
me,	1
my	1
lord?	1
_Ham._	1
Excellent	1
well;	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
fishmonger.[26]	1
_Pol._	1
Not	1
I,	1
my	1
lord.	1
_Ham._	1
Then	1
I	1
would	1
you	1
were	1
so	1
honest	1
a	1
man.	1
_Pol._	1
Honest,	1
my	1
lord!	1
_Ham._	1
Ay,	1
sir;	1
to	1
be	1
honest,	1
as	1
this	1
world	1
goes,	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
man	1
picked	1
out	1
of	1
ten	1
thousand.	1
_Pol._	1
That's	1
very	1
true,	1
my	1
lord.	1
_Ham._	1
For	1
if	1
the	1
sun	1
breed	1
maggots	1
in	1
a	1
dead	1
dog,	1
being	1
a	1
god,	1
kissing	1
carrion,----Have	1
you	1
a	1
daughter?[27]	1
_Pol._	1
I	1
have,	1
my	1
lord.	1
_Ham._	1
Let	1
her	1
not	1
walk	1
i'the	1
sun:	1
conception	1
is	1
a	1
blessing;	1
but	1
as	1
your	1
daughter	1
may	1
conceive,--friend,	1
look	1
to't,	1
look	1
to't,	1
look	1
to't.	1
[_Goes	1
up	1
stage._]	1
_Pol._	1
(_Aside._)	1
Still	1
harping	1
on	1
my	1
daughter:--yet	1
he	1
knew	1
me	1
not	1
at	1
first;	1
he	1
said	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
fishmonger.	1
[_Crosses	1
to_	1
L.]	1
I'll	1
speak	1
to	1
him	1
again.--What	1
do	1
you	1
read,	1
my	1
lord?	1
_Ham._	1
(C.)	1
Words,	1
words,	1
words.	1
_Pol._	1
(L.)	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
matter,	1
my	1
lord?	1
_Ham._	1
Between	1
who?	1
_Pol._	1
I	1
mean,	1
the	1
matter	1
that	1
you	1
read,	1
my	1
lord.	1
_Ham._	1
Slanders,	1
sir:	1
for	1
the	1
satirical	1
rogue[28]	1
says	1
here	1
that	1
old	1
men	1
have	1
grey	1
beards;	1
that	1
their	1
faces	1
are	1
wrinkled;	1
their	1
eyes	1
purging	1
thick	1
amber	1
and	1
plum-tree	1
gum;	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
a	1
plentiful	1
lack	1
of	1
wit,	1
together	1
with	1
most	1
weak	1
hams:	1
All	1
of	1
which,	1
sir,	1
though	1
I	1
most	1
powerfully	1
and	1
potently	1
believe,	1
yet	1
I	1
hold	1
it	1
not	1
honesty	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
thus	1
set	1
down;	1
for	1
yourself,	1
sir,	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
old	1
as	1
I	1
am,	1
if,	1
like	1
a	1
crab,	1
you	1
could	1
go	1
backward.	1
[_Crosses_,	1
L.]	1
_Pol._	1
(_Aside._)	1
Though	1
this	1
be	1
madness,	1
yet	1
there's	1
method	1
in	1
it.	1
Will	1
you	1
walk	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
air,	1
my	1
lord?	1
_Ham._	1
Into	1
my	1
grave?	1
[_Crosses_	1
R.]	1
_Pol._	1
(L.)	1
Indeed,	1
that	1
is	1
out	1
o'	1
the	1
air.--How	1
pregnant	1
sometimes	1
his	1
replies[29]	1
are!	1
a	1
happiness	1
that	1
often	1
madness	1
hits	1
on,	1
which	1
reason	1
and	1
sanity	1
could	1
not	1
so	1
prosperously	1
be	1
delivered	1
of.	1
I	1
will	1
leave	1
him,	1
and	1
suddenly	1
contrive	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
meeting	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
my	1
daughter.--My	1
honourable	1
lord,	1
I	1
will	1
most	1
humbly	1
take	1
my	1
leave	1
of	1
you.	1
_Ham._	1
(C.)	1
You	1
cannot,	1
sir,	1
take	1
from	1
me	1
any	1
thing	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
more	1
willingly	1
part	1
withall,	1
except	1
my	1
life,	1
except	1
my	1

my	1

lord!--	1
_Ros._	1
My	1
most	1
dear	1
lord!--	1
_Ham._	1
My	1
excellent	1
good	1
friends!	1
How	1
dost	1
thou,	1
Guildenstern?	1
[_Crosses	1
to_	1
ROSENCRANTZ.]	1
Ah,	1
Rosencrantz!	1
Good	1
lads,	1
how	1
do	1
ye	1
both?	1
What	1
news?	1
_Ros._	1
(L.)	1
None,	1
my	1
lord,	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
world's	1
grown	1
honest.	1
_Ham._	1
(C.)	1
Then	1
is	1
dooms-day	1
near:	1
but	1
your	1
news	1
is	1
not	1
true.	1
In	1
the	1
beaten	1
way	1
of	1
friendship,[30]	1
what	1
make	1
you	1
at	1
Elsinore?	1
_Ros._	1
To	1
visit	1
you,	1
my	1
lord;	1
no	1
other	1
occasion.	1
_Ham._	1
Beggar	1
that	1
I	1
am,	1
I	1
am	1
even	1
poor	1
in	1
thanks;	1
but	1
I	1
thank	1
you.	1
Were	1
you	1
not	1
sent	1
for?	1
Is	1
it	1
your	1
own	1
inclining?	1
Is	1
it	1
a	1
free	1
visitation?	1
Come,	1
come,	1
deal	1
justly	1
with	1
me:	1
come,	1
come;	1
nay,	1
speak.	1
_Guil._	1
(R.)	1
What	1
should	1
we	1
say,	1
my	1
lord?	1
_Ham._	1
Any	1
thing--but	1
to	1
the	1
purpose.	1
You	1
were	1
sent	1
for;	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
confession	1
in	1
your	1
looks,	1
which	1
your	1
modesties	1
have	1
not	1
craft	1
enough	1
to	1
colour:	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
good	1
king	1
and	1
queen	1
have	1
sent	1
for	1
you.	1
_Ros._	1
To	1
what	1
end,	1
my	1
lord?	1
_Ham._	1
That	1
you	1
must	1
teach	1
me.	1
But	1
let	1
me	1
conjure	1
you,	1
by	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
our	1
fellowship,	1
[_taking	1
their	1
hands_,]	1
by	1
the	1
consonancy	1
of	1
our	1
youth,[31]	1
by	1
the	1
obligation	1
of	1
our	1
ever-preserved	1
love,	1
and	1
by	1
what	1
more	1
dear	1
a	1
better	1
proposer[32]	1
could	1
charge	1
you	1
withal,	1
be	1
even[33]	1
and	1
direct	1
with	1
me,	1
whether	1
you	1
were	1
sent	1
for,	1
or	1
no?	1
_Ros._	1
What	1
say	1
you?	1
[_To_	1
GUILDENSTERN.]	1
_Ham._	1
Nay,	1
then,	1
I	1
have	1
an	1
eye	1
of	1
you.[34]	1
[_Crosses_	1
R.]	1
[_Aside._]	1
--if	1
you	1
love	1
me,	1
hold	1
not	1
off.	1
_Guil._	1
My	1
lord,	1
we	1
were	1
sent	1
for.	1
_Ham._	1
(_Returning_	1
C.)	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
why;	1
so	1
shall	1
my	1
anticipation	1
prevent	1
your	1
discovery,	1
and	1
your	1
secrecy	1
to	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
queen	1
moult	1
no	1
feather.[35]	1
I	1
have	1
of	1
late	1
(but	1
wherefore	1
I	1
know	1
not)	1
lost	1
all	1
my	1
mirth,	1
forgone	1
all	1
custom	1
of	1
exercises;	1
and,	1
indeed,	1
it	1
goes	1
so	1
heavily	1
with	1
my	1
disposition,	1
that	1
this	1
goodly	1
frame,	1
the	1
earth,	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
steril	1
promontory;	1
this	1
most	1
excellent	1
canopy,	1
the	1
air,	1
look	1
you,	1
this	1
brave	1
o'erhanging	1
firmament,	1
this	1
majestical	1
roof	1
fretted	1
with	1
golden	1
fire,	1
why,	1
it	1
appears	1
no	1
other	1
thing	1
to	1
me	1
than	1
a	1
foul	1
and	1
pestilent	1
congregation	1
of	1
vapours.	1
What	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
work	1
is	1
man!	1
How	1
noble	1
in	1
reason!	1
how	1
infinite	1
in	1
faculties!	1
in	1
form	1
and	1
moving	1
how	1
express[36]	1
and	1
admirable!	1
in	1
action	1
how	1
like	1
an	1
angel!	1
in	1
apprehension	1
how	1
like	1
a	1
god!	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
world!	1
the	1
paragon[37]	1
of	1
animals!	1
And	1
yet,	1
to	1
me,	1
what	1
is	1
this	1
quintessence	1
of	1
dust?	1
man	1
delights	1
not	1
me,--nor	1
woman	1
neither,	1
though	1
by	1
your	1
smiling	1
you	1
seem	1
to	1
say	1
so.	1
_Ros._	1
My	1
lord,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
such	1
stuff	1
in	1
my	1
thoughts.	1
_Ham._	1
Why	1
did	1
you	1
laugh,	1
then,	1
when	1
I	1
said,	1
_Man	1
delights	1
not	1
me?_	1
_Ros._	1
To	1
think,	1
my	1
lord,	1
if	1
you	1
delight	1
not	1
in	1
man,	1
what	1
lenten	1
entertainment[38]	1
the	1
players	1
shall	1
receive	1
from	1
you:	1
we	1
coted	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
way;[39]	1
and	1
hither	1
are	1
they	1
coming,	1
to	1
offer	1
you	1
service.	1
_Ham._	1
He	1
that	1
plays	1
the	1
king	1
shall	1
be	1
welcome,	1
his	1
majesty	1
shall	1
have	1
tribute	1
of	1
me;	1
the	1
adventurous	1
knight	1
shall	1
use	1
his	1
foil	1
and	1
target;	1
the	1
lover	1
shall	1
not	1
sigh	1
gratis;	1
the	1
humorous	1
man	1
shall	1
end	1
his	1
part	1
in	1
peace;[40]	1
and	1
the	1
lady	1
shall	1
say	1
her	1
mind	1
freely,	1
or	1
the	1
blank	1
verse	1
shall	1
halt	1
for't.[41]--What	1
players	1
are	1
they?	1
_Ros._	1
Even	1
those	1
you	1
were	1
wont	1
to	1
take	1
such	1
delight	1
in,	1
the	1
tragedians	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
_Ham._	1
How	1
chances	1
it,	1
they	1
travel?[42]	1
their	1
residence,	1
both	1
in	1
reputation	1
and	1
profit,	1
was	1
better	1
both	1
ways.	1
Do	1
they	1
hold	1
the	1
same	1
estimation	1
they	1
did	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
city?	1
Are	1
they	1
so	1
followed?	1
_Ros._	1
No,	1
indeed,	1
they	1
are	1
not.	1
_Ham._	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
very	1
strange;	1
for	1
my	1
uncle	1
is	1
king	1
of	1
Denmark,[43]	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
would	1
make	1
mouths	1
at	1
him[44]	1
while	1
my	1
father	1
lived,	1
give	1
twenty,	1
forty,	1
fifty,	1
an	1
hundred	1
ducats	1
a-piece	1
for	1
his	1
picture	1
in	1
little.[45]	1
There	1
is	1
something	1
in	1
this	1
more	1
than	1
natural,	1
if	1
philosophy	1
could	1
find	1
it	1
out.	1
[_Flourish	1
of	1
trumpets	1

_Guil._	1
There	1
are	1
the	1
players.	1
_Ham._	1
Gentlemen,	1
you	1
are	1
welcome	1
to	1
Elsinore.	1
Your	1
hands.	1
You	1
are	1
welcome:	1
but	1
my	1
uncle-father	1
and	1
aunt-mother	1
are	1
deceived.	1
_Guil._	1
In	1
what,	1
my	1
dear	1
lord?	1
_Ham._	1
I	1
am	1
but	1
mad	1
north-north	1
west:	1
when	1
the	1
wind	1
is	1
southerly	1
I	1
know	1
a	1
hawk	1
from	1
a	1
hern-shaw.[46]	1
[_Crosses_	1
R.]	1
_Pol._	1
(_Without_,	1
L.H.)	1
Well	1
be	1
with	1
you,	1
gentlemen!	1
_Ham._	1
(_Crosses_	1
C.)	1
Hark	1
you,	1
Guildenstern;--and	1
Rosencrantz:	1
that	1
great	1
baby	1
you	1
see	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
swaddling-clouts.	1
_Ros._	1
(R.)	1
Haply	1
he's	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
come	1
to	1
them;	1
for	1
they	1
say	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
is	1
twice	1
a	1
child.	1
_Ham._	1
I	1
will	1
prophesy	1
he	1
comes	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
players;	1
mark	1
it.--You	1
say	1
right,	1
sir:	1
o'Monday	1
morning;	1
'twas	1
then,	1
indeed.	1
_Enter_	1
POLONIUS	1
(L.H.)	1
_Pol._	1
My	1
lord,	1
I	1
have	1
news	1
to	1
tell	1
you.	1
_Ham._	1
My	1
lord,	1
I	1
have	1
news	1
to	1
tell	1
you.	1
When	1
Roscius	1
was	1
an	1
actor	1
in	1
Rome,----	1
_Pol._	1
The	1
actors	1
are	1
come	1
hither,	1
my	1
lord.	1
_Ham._	1
Buz,	1
buz![47]	1
_Pol._	1
Upon	1
my	1
honour,----	1
_Ham._	1
Then	1
came	1
each	1
actor	1
on	1
his	1
ass.[48]	1
_Pol._	1
The	1
best	1
actors	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
either	1
for	1
tragedy,	1
comedy,	1
history,	1
pastoral,	1
pastorical-comical,	1
historical-pastoral,	1
scene	1
indivisible,	1
or	1
poem	1
unlimited:	1
Seneca	1
cannot	1
be	1
too	1
heavy,	1
nor	1
Plautus	1
too	1
light.[49]	1
For	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
writ	1
and	1
the	1
liberty,	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
only	1
men.[50]	1
_Ham._	1
_O,	1
Jephthah,	1
judge	1
of	1
Israel_,--what	1
a	1
treasure	1
hadst	1
thou!	1
_Pol._	1
What	1
a	1
treasure	1
had	1
he,	1
my	1
lord?	1
_Ham._	1
Why,--_One	1
fair	1
daughter,	1
and	1
no	1
more,	1
The	1
which	1
he	1
loved	1
passing	1
well._	1
_Pol._	1
Still	1
harping	1
on	1
my	1
daughter.	1
[_Aside._]	1
_Ham._	1
Am	1
I	1
not	1
i'the	1
right,	1
old	1
Jephthah?	1
_Pol._	1
If	1
you	1
call	1
me	1
Jephthah,	1
my	1
lord,	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
daughter	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
passing	1
well.	1
_Ham._	1
Nay,	1
that	1
follows	1
not.	1
_Pol._	1
What	1
follows,	1
then,	1
my	1
lord?	1
_Ham._	1
Why,	1
_As	1
by	1
lot,	1
God	1
wot_,[51]	1
and	1
then,	1
you	1
know,	1
_It	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
As	1
most	1
like	1
it	1
was_,--The	1
first	1
row	1
of	1
the	1
pious	1
Chanson[52]	1
will	1
show	1
you	1
more;	1
for	1
look,	1
my	1
abridgment	1
comes.[53]	1
_Enter	1
Four	1
or	1
Five_	1
Players	1
(L.H.)--POLONIUS	1
_crosses	1

HAMLET	1
_to_	1
R.H.	1
You	1
are	1
welcome,	1
masters;	1
welcome,	1
all:	1
O,	1
old	1
friend!	1
Why,	1
thy	1
face	1
is	1
valanced[54]	1
since	1
I	1
saw	1
thee	1
last;	1
Com'st	1
thou	1
to	1
beard	1
me[55]	1
in	1
Denmark?--What,	1
my	1
young	1
lady	1
and	1
mistress.	1
By-'r-lady,	1
your	1
ladyship	1
is	1
nearer	1
to	1
heaven	1
than	1
when	1
I	1
saw	1
you	1
last,	1
by	1
the	1
altitude	1
of	1
a	1
chopine.[56]	1
You	1
are	1
welcome.	1
We'll	1
e'en	1
to't	1
like	1
French	1
falconers,[57]	1
fly	1
at	1
anything	1
we	1
see:	1
We'll	1
have	1
a	1
speech	1
straight:	1
Come,	1
give	1
us	1
a	1
taste	1
of	1
your	1
quality;[58]	1
come,	1
a	1
passionate	1
speech.	1
_1st	1
Play._	1
(L.H.)	1
What	1
speech,	1
my	1
lord?	1
_Ham._	1
I	1
heard	1
thee	1
speak	1
me	1
a	1
speech	1
once,--but	1
it	1
was	1
never	1
acted;	1
or,	1
if	1
it	1
was,	1
not	1
above	1
once;	1
for	1
the	1
play,	1
I	1
remember,	1
pleased	1
not	1
the	1
million;	1
'twas	1
caviare	1
to	1
the	1
general:[59]	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
excellent	1
play,	1
well	1
digested	1
in	1
the	1
scenes,	1
set	1
down	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
modesty	1
as	1
cunning.[60]	1
One	1
speech	1
in	1
it	1
I	1
chiefly	1
loved;	1
'twas	1
Æneas'	1
tale	1
to	1
Dido;	1
and	1
thereabout	1
of	1
it	1
especially,	1
where	1
he	1
speaks	1
of	1
Priam's	1
slaughter:	1
If	1
it	1
live	1
in	1
your	1
memory,	1
begin	1
at	1
this	1
line;	1
let	1
me	1
see,	1
let	1
me	1
see;--	1
_The	1
rugged	1
Pyrrhus,	1
like	1
the	1
Hyrcanian	1
beast_,--'tis	1
not	1
so:	1
it	1
begins	1
with	1
Pyrrhus:	1
_The	1
rugged	1
Pyrrhus,--he,	1
whose	1
sable	1
arms_,	1
_Black	1
as	1
his	1
purpose,	1
did	1
the	1
night	1
resemble_,	1
_Old	1
grandsire	1
Priam	1
seeks._	1
_Pol._	1
(R.)	1
'Fore	1
Heaven,	1
my	1
lord,	1
well	1
spoken,	1
with	1
good	1
accent	1
and	1
good	1
discretion.	1
_Ham._	1

So	1
proceed	1
you.	1
_1st	1

(L.)	1
_Anon	1
he	1

too	1
short	1

Greeks;	1
his	1
antique	1
sword,	1
Rebellious	1
to	1
his	1
arm,	1
lies	1
where	1
it	1
falls,	1
Repugnant	1
to	1
command:	1
Unequal	1
match'd,	1
Pyrrhus	1
at	1
Priam	1
drives;	1
in	1
rage	1
strikes	1
wide;	1
But	1
with	1
the	1
whiff	1
and	1
wind	1
of	1
his	1
fell	1
sword[61]	1
The	1
unnerved	1
father	1
falls.	1
But,	1
as	1
we	1
often	1
see,	1
against	1
some	1
storm,	1
A	1
silence	1
in	1
the	1
heavens,	1
the	1
rack[62]	1
stand	1
still,	1
The	1
bold	1
wind	1
speechless,	1

the	1

As	1
hush	1
as	1
death;	1
anon	1
the	1
dreadful	1

So,	1
after	1
Pyrrhus'	1
pause,	1
A	1
roused	1
vengeance	1
sets	1
him	1
new	1
a	1
work;	1
And	1
never	1
did	1
the	1
Cyclops'	1
hammers	1
fall	1
On	1
Mars's	1
armour,	1
forg'd	1
for	1
proof	1
eterne,	1
With	1
less	1
remorse	1
than	1
Pyrrhus'	1
bleeding	1
sword	1

my	1
lord,	1
will	1
you	1
see	1
the	1
players	1
well	1
bestowed?	1
Do	1
you	1
hear,	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
well	1
used;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
abstract	1
and	1
brief	1
chronicles	1
of	1
the	1
time:	1
After	1
your	1
death	1
you	1
were	1
better	1
have	1
a	1
bad	1
epitaph	1
than	1
their	1
ill	1
report	1
while	1
you	1
live.	1
_Pol._	1
(R.)	1
My	1
lord,	1
I	1
will	1
use	1
them	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
desert.	1
_Ham._	1
Much	1
better:	1
Use	1
every	1
man	1
after	1
his	1
desert,	1
and	1
who	1
shall	1
'scape	1
whipping?	1
Use	1
them	1
after	1
your	1
own	1
honour	1
and	1
dignity:	1
The	1
less	1
they	1
deserve,	1
the	1
more	1
merit	1
is	1
in	1
your	1
bounty.	1
Take	1
them	1
in.	1

in	1

A	1
broken	1

his	1
whole	1

suiting	1
With	1

all	1
for	1
nothing!	1
For	1
Hecuba?	1
What's	1
Hecuba	1
to	1
him,	1
or	1
he	1
to	1
Hecuba,	1
That	1
he	1

he	1
the	1
motive	1

the	1
cue[66]	1
for	1

would	1
drown	1
the	1
stage	1
with	1
tears,	1
And	1
cleave	1
the	1

ear	1
with	1
horrid	1

mad	1

appal	1

the	1

I,	1
A	1
dull	1

rascal,	1
peak,	1
Like	1
John	1
a-dreams,[67]	1
unpregnant	1
of	1
my	1
cause,[68]	1
And	1
can	1

a	1

Upon	1
whose	1

defeat	1

across?	1
Plucks	1
off	1

blows	1
it	1

Tweaks	1
me	1
by	1

gives	1
me	1
the	1
lie	1
i'the	1
throat,	1
As	1
deep	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
lungs?	1
Who	1
does	1
me	1
this,	1
Ha?	1
Why,	1
I	1
should	1
take	1
it:	1
for	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
But	1
I	1
am	1
pigeon-liver'd,	1
and	1
lack	1
gall	1
To	1
make	1
oppression	1
bitter;[70]	1

scullion!	1
Fye	1
upon't!	1
fye!	1
About,	1

brains![72]	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
That	1
guilty	1
creatures,	1
sitting	1
at	1
a	1
play,	1
Have	1
by	1
the	1
very	1
cunning	1
of	1
the	1
scene	1
Been	1
struck	1
so	1
to	1
the	1
soul,	1
that	1
presently	1
They	1
have	1
proclaim'd	1
their	1
malefactions;	1
For	1
murder,	1
though	1
it	1
have	1
no	1
tongue,	1
will	1
speak	1
With	1
most	1
miraculous	1
organ.	1
I'll	1
have	1
these	1
players	1
Play	1
something	1
like	1
the	1
murder	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
Before	1
mine	1
uncle:	1
I'll	1
observe	1
his	1
looks;	1
I'll	1
tent	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
quick:[73]	1
if	1
he	1
do	1
blench,[74]	1
I	1
know	1
my	1
course.	1
The	1
spirit	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
May	1
be	1
the	1
devil:	1
and	1
the	1
devil	1
hath	1
power	1
To	1
assume	1
a	1
pleasing	1
shape;	1
yea,	1
and,	1
perhaps	1
Out	1
of	1
my	1
weakness	1
and	1
my	1
melancholy	1
(As	1
he	1
is	1
very	1
potent	1
with	1
such	1
spirits),	1
Abuses	1
me	1
to	1
damn	1
me:	1
I'll	1
have	1
good	1
grounds	1
More	1
relative	1
than	1
this:[75]	1
The	1
play's	1
the	1
thing	1
Wherein	1
I'll	1
catch	1
the	1
conscience	1
of	1
the	1
king.	1

Act	1
II	1
[Footnote	1
II.1:	1
_Polonius_,]	1
Doctor	1
Johnson	1
describes	1
Polonius	1
as	1
"a	1
man	1
bred	1
in	1
courts,	1
exercised	1

stored	1
with	1
observation,	1
confident	1
in	1
his	1
knowledge,	1
proud	1
of	1
his	1
eloquence,	1
and	1
declining	1
into	1
dotage.	1
A	1
man	1
positive	1
and	1
confident,	1
because	1
he	1
knows	1
his	1
mind	1
was	1
once	1
strong,	1
and	1
knows	1
not	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
become	1
weak."	1
The	1
idea	1
of	1
dotage	1
encroaching	1
upon	1
wisdom	1
will	1
solve	1
all	1

to	1
the	1

for	1
(being	1

the	1

age,	1
to	1

acts	1

_You	1

This	1
was	1
an	1
expression	1
better	1
understood	1
in	1
Shakespeare's	1
time	1
than	1
at	1
present,	1
and	1
no	1
doubt	1
was	1
relished	1
by	1
the	1
audience	1
of	1
the	1
Globe	1
Theatre	1
as	1
applicable	1
to	1
the	1
Papists,	1
who	1
in	1
Queen	1
Elizabeth's	1
time	1
were	1
esteemed	1
enemies	1
to	1
the	1
Government.	1
Hence	1
the	1
proverbial	1
phrase	1
of	1
_He's	1

no	1
fish_;	1
to	1
signify	1
he's	1

_i.e._,	1
Hamlet	1
having	1
just	1
remarked	1
that	1
honesty	1
is	1
very	1
rare	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
adds,	1
that	1
since	1
there	1
is	1
so	1
little	1
virtue,	1
since	1
corruption	1
abounds	1
everywhere,	1
and	1
maggots	1
are	1
_bred_	1
by	1
the	1
sun,	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
god,	1
even	1
in	1
a	1
dead	1
dog,	1
Polonius	1
ought	1
to	1
take	1
care	1
to	1
prevent	1
his	1
daughter	1
from	1
walking	1
in	1
the	1
sun,	1
lest	1
she	1
should	1
prove	1
_"a	1
breeder	1
of	1
sinners;"_	1
for	1
though	1
_conception_	1
(understanding)	1
in	1
general	1
be	1
a	1
blessing,	1
yet	1
as	1
Ophelia	1
might	1
chance	1
to	1
_conceive_	1
(to	1
be	1
pregnant),	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
calamity.	1
Hamlet's	1
abrupt	1
question,	1
_"Have	1
you	1
a	1
daughter?"_	1
is	1
evidently	1
intended	1
to	1
impress	1
Polonius	1

the	1

madness.--MALONE.]	1

_Ham._	1
To	1
be,	1
or	1
not	1
to	1
be,	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
question:[8]	1
Whether	1
'tis	1
nobler	1
in	1
the	1
mind	1
to	1
suffer	1
The	1
slings	1
and	1
arrows	1
of	1
outrageous	1
fortune,	1
Or	1
to	1
take	1
arms	1
against	1
a	1
sea	1
of	1
troubles,[9]	1
And,	1
by	1
opposing	1
end	1
them?--To	1
die,--to	1
sleep,	1
No	1
more;--and	1
by	1
a	1
sleep,	1
to	1
say	1
we	1
end	1
The	1
heart-ache,	1
and	1
the	1
thousand	1
natural	1
shocks	1
That	1
flesh	1
is	1
heir	1
to:	1
'tis	1
a	1
consummation	1
Devoutly	1
to	1
be	1
wished.	1
To	1
die,--to	1
sleep,--	1
To	1
sleep!	1
perchance	1
to	1
dream:	1
ay,	1
there's	1
the	1
rub;	1
For	1
in	1
that	1
sleep	1
of	1
death	1
what	1
dreams	1
may	1
come,	1
When	1
we	1
have	1
shuffled	1
off	1
this	1
mortal	1
coil,[10]	1
Must	1
give	1
us	1
pause:[11]	1
There's	1
the	1
respect[12]	1
That	1
makes	1
calamity	1
of	1
so	1
long	1
life;	1
For	1
who	1
would	1
bear	1
the	1
whips	1
and	1
scorns	1
of	1
time,[13]	1
The	1
oppressor's	1
wrong,	1
the	1
proud	1
man's	1
contumely,[14]	1
The	1
pangs	1
of	1
despised	1
love,	1
the	1
law's	1
delay,	1
The	1
insolence	1
of	1
office,	1
and	1
the	1
spurns	1
That	1
patient	1
merit	1
of	1
the	1
unworthy	1
takes,	1
When	1
he	1
himself	1
might	1
his	1
quietus	1
make[15]	1
With	1
a	1
bare	1
bodkin?[16]	1
Who	1
would	1
fardels	1
bear,[17]	1
To	1
groan	1
and	1
sweat	1
under	1
a	1
weary	1
life,	1
But	1
that	1
the	1
dread	1
of	1
something	1
after	1
death,	1
The	1
undiscovered	1
country,	1
from	1
whose	1
bourn[18]	1
No	1
traveller	1
returns,[19]	1
puzzles	1
the	1
will,	1
And	1
makes	1
us	1
rather	1
bear	1
those	1
ills	1
we	1
have	1
Than	1
fly	1
to	1
others	1
that	1
we	1
know	1
not	1
of?	1
Thus,	1
conscience	1
does	1
make	1
cowards	1
of	1
us	1
all;[20]	1
And	1
thus	1
the	1
native	1
hue	1
of	1
resolution	1
Is	1
sicklied	1
o'er	1
with	1
the	1
pale	1
cast	1
of	1
thought;	1
And	1
enterprises	1
of	1
great	1
pith	1
and	1
moment,[21]	1
With	1
this	1
regard,	1
their	1
currents	1
turn	1
away,	1
And	1
lose	1
the	1

of	1

your	1

for	1

_Ham._	1
(L.C.)	1
I	1
humbly	1

you;	1
well.	1
_Oph._	1
My	1

I	1
have	1
remembrances	1
of	1
yours,	1
That	1
I	1
have	1
longèd	1
long	1
to	1
re-deliver;	1
I	1
pray	1
you,	1
now	1
receive	1
them.	1
_Ham._	1
No,	1
not	1
I;	1
I	1
never	1
gave	1
you	1
aught.	1
_Oph._	1
My	1
honour'd	1
lord,	1
you	1
know	1
right	1
well	1
you	1
did;	1
And,	1
with	1
them,	1
words	1
of	1
so	1
sweet	1
breath	1
compos'd	1
As	1
made	1
the	1
things	1
more	1
rich:	1
their	1
perfume	1
lost,	1
Take	1
these	1
again;	1
for	1
to	1
the	1
noble	1

Rich	1

poor	1
when	1

There,	1
my	1

_Ham._	1
Ha,	1
ha!	1
are	1
you	1

_Oph._	1
My	1

_Ham._	1
Are	1
you	1
fair?	1
_Oph._	1
What	1
means	1
your	1
lordship?	1
_Ham._	1
That	1
if	1
you	1
be	1
honest	1
and	1
fair,	1
your	1
honesty	1
should	1
admit	1
no	1
discourse	1
to	1
your	1
beauty.[25]	1
_Oph._	1
Could	1
beauty,	1
my	1
lord,	1
have	1
better	1
commerce	1
than	1
with	1
honesty?	1
_Ham._	1
Ay,	1
truly;	1
for	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
beauty	1
will	1
sooner	1
transform	1
honesty	1
from	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
a	1
bawd,	1
than	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
honesty	1
can	1
translate	1
beauty	1
into	1
his	1
likeness:[26]	1
this	1
was	1
some	1
time	1
a	1
paradox,	1
but	1
now	1
the	1
time	1
gives	1
it	1
proof.	1
I	1
did	1
love	1
you	1
once.	1
_Oph._	1
Indeed,	1
my	1
lord,	1
you	1
made	1
me	1
believe	1
so.	1
_Ham._	1
You	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
believed	1
me;	1
for	1
virtue	1
cannot	1
so	1
inoculate	1
our	1
old	1
stock,	1
but	1
we	1
shall	1
relish	1
of	1
it:[27]	1
I	1
loved	1
you	1
not.	1
_Oph._	1
I	1
was	1
the	1
more	1
deceived.	1
_Ham._	1
Get	1
thee	1
to	1
a	1
nunnery:	1
Why	1
wouldst	1
thou	1
be	1
a	1
breeder	1
of	1
sinners?	1
I	1
am	1
myself	1
indifferent	1
honest;	1
but	1
yet	1
I	1
could	1
accuse	1
me	1
of	1
such	1
things,	1
that	1
it	1
were	1
better	1
my	1
mother	1
had	1
not	1
borne	1
me:	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
proud,	1
revengeful,	1
ambitious;	1
with	1
more	1
offences	1
at	1
my	1
beck[28]	1
than	1
I	1
have	1
thoughts	1
to	1
put	1
them	1
in,[29]	1
imagination	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
shape,	1
or	1
time	1
to	1
act	1
them	1
in.	1
What	1
should	1
such	1
fellows	1
as	1
I	1
do,	1
crawling	1
between	1
earth	1
and	1
heaven?	1
We	1
are	1
arrant	1
knaves,	1
all;	1
believe	1
none	1
of	1
us.	1
Go	1
thy	1

Where's	1
your	1
father?	1
_Oph._	1
At	1

that	1

Farewell.	1
_Oph._	1
O,	1
help	1
him,	1
you	1
sweet	1
heavens!	1
_Ham._	1
If	1
thou	1
dost	1
marry,	1
I'll	1
give	1
thee	1
this	1
plague	1
for	1
thy	1
dowry.	1
Be	1

Or,	1
if	1

marry	1

for	1

for	1
any	1

the	1

whose	1

both	1
at	1

question[56]	1
of	1
the	1

be	1

a	1
most	1
pitiful	1

(R.H.)	1
_Hor._	1
Here,	1
sweet	1
lord,	1
at	1
your	1

_Ham._	1
Horatio,	1
thou	1
art	1
e'en	1
as	1
just	1
a	1
man	1
As	1
e'er	1
my	1
conversation	1
cop'd	1
withal.[57]	1
_Hor._	1
O,	1
my	1
dear	1
lord.	1
_Ham._	1
Nay,	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
I	1
flatter;	1
For	1
what	1
advancement	1
may	1
I	1
hope	1
from	1
thee,	1
That	1
no	1
revenue	1
hast,	1
but	1
thy	1
good	1
spirits,	1
To	1
feed	1
and	1
clothe	1
thee?	1
Why	1
should	1
the	1
poor	1
be	1
flatter'd?	1
No,	1
let	1
the	1
candied	1
tongue	1
lick	1
absurd	1
pomp;	1
And	1
crook	1
the	1
pregnant	1
hinges	1
of	1
the	1
knee,[58]	1
Where	1
thrift	1
may	1
follow	1
fawning.	1
Dost	1
thou	1
hear?	1
Since	1
my	1
dear	1
soul[59]	1
was	1
mistress	1
of	1
her	1
choice,	1
And	1
could	1
of	1
men	1
distinguish,	1
her	1
election	1
Hath	1
seal'd	1
thee	1
for	1
herself:	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
As	1
one,	1
in	1
suffering	1
all,	1
that	1
suffers	1
nothing;	1
A	1
man	1
that	1
fortune's	1
buffets	1
and	1
rewards	1
Has	1
ta'en	1
with	1
equal	1
thanks:	1
and	1
bless'd	1
are	1
those	1
Whose	1
blood	1
and	1
judgment[60]	1
are	1
so	1
well	1
co-mingled,	1
That	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
a	1
pipe	1
for	1
fortune's	1
finger	1
To	1
sound	1
what	1
stop	1
she	1
please.	1
Give	1
me	1
that	1
man	1
That	1
is	1
not	1
passion's	1
slave,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
wear	1
him	1
In	1
my	1
heart's	1
core,	1
ay,	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
of	1
heart,	1
As	1
I	1
do	1
thee.--Something	1
too	1
much	1
of	1
this.--	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
play	1
to-night	1
before	1
the	1
king;	1
One	1
scene	1
of	1
it	1
comes	1
near	1
the	1
circumstance	1
Which	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
thee	1
of	1
my	1
father's	1
death:	1
I	1
pr'ythee	1
when	1
thou	1
seest	1
that	1
act	1
a-foot,	1
Even	1
with	1
the	1
very	1
comment	1
of	1
thy	1
soul[61]	1
Observe	1
my	1
uncle:	1
if	1
his	1
occulted	1
guilt[62]	1
Do	1
not	1
itself	1
unkennel	1
in	1
one	1
speech,	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
damned	1
ghost	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
seen;	1
And	1
my	1
imaginations	1
are	1
as	1
foul	1
As	1
Vulcan's	1
stithy.[63]	1
Give	1
him	1
heedful	1
note:	1
For	1
I	1
mine	1
eyes	1
will	1
rivet	1
to	1
his	1
face;	1
And,	1
after,	1
we	1
will	1
both	1
our	1
judgments	1
join	1
In	1
censure	1
of	1
his	1
seeming.[64]	1

so	1
wildly	1
from	1
my	1
affair.	1
_Ham._	1
I	1
am	1
tame,	1
sir:--pronounce.	1
_Guil._	1
The	1
queen,	1
your	1
mother,	1
in	1
most	1
great	1
affliction	1
of	1
spirit,	1
hath	1
sent	1
me	1
to	1
you.	1
_Ham._	1
You	1
are	1
welcome.	1
_Guil._	1
Nay,	1
good	1
my	1
lord,	1
this	1
courtesy	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
right	1
breed.	1
If	1
it	1
shall	1
please	1
you	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
a	1
wholesome	1
answer,	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
your	1
mother's	1
commandment:	1
if	1
not,	1
your	1
pardon	1
and	1
my	1
return	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
my	1
business.	1
_Ham._	1
Sir,	1
I	1
cannot.	1
_Guil._	1
What,	1
my	1
lord?	1
_Ham._	1
Make	1
you	1
a	1
wholesome	1
answer;	1
my	1
wit's	1
diseased!	1
But,	1
sir,	1
such	1
answer	1
as	1
I	1
can	1
make,	1
you	1
shall	1
command:	1
or	1
rather	1
as	1
you	1
say,	1
my	1
mother:	1
therefore	1
no	1
more,	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
matter:	1
My	1
mother,	1
you	1
say,--	1
_Ros._	1
(_Crosses	1
to_	1
C.)	1
Then	1
thus	1
she	1
says:	1
Your	1
behaviour	1
hath	1
struck	1
her	1
into	1
amazement	1
and	1
admiration.[93]	1
_Ham._	1
O	1
wonderful	1
son,	1
that	1
can	1
so	1
astonish	1
a	1
mother!	1
But	1
is	1
there	1
no	1
sequel	1
at	1
the	1
heels	1
of	1
this	1
mother's	1
admiration?--impart.	1
_Ros._	1
She	1
desires	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
you	1
in	1
her	1
closet,	1
ere	1
you	1
go	1
to	1
bed.	1
_Ham._	1
We	1
shall	1
obey,	1
were	1
she	1
ten	1
times	1
our	1
mother.	1
Have	1
you	1
any	1
further	1
trade	1
with	1
us?[94]	1
_Ros._	1
My	1
lord,	1
you	1
once	1
did	1
love	1
me.	1
_Ham._	1
And	1
do	1
still,	1
by	1
these	1
pickers	1
and	1
stealers.[95]	1
[_Rises	1

_Ros._	1
(R.)	1
Good	1
my	1
lord,	1
what	1
is	1
your	1
cause	1
of	1
distemper?	1
you	1
do,	1
surely,	1
bar	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
liberty,	1
if	1
you	1
deny	1
your	1
griefs	1
to	1
your	1
friend.[96]	1
_Ham._	1
Sir,	1
I	1
lack	1
advancement.	1
_Ros._	1
How	1
can	1
that	1
be,	1
when	1
you	1
have	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
himself	1
for	1
your	1
succession	1
in	1
Denmark?[97]	1
_Ham._	1
Ay,	1
sir,	1
but	1
_While	1

is	1

musty.[98]	1

you	1

recover	1
the	1

me,[100]	1
as	1
if	1
you	1

me	1
into	1
a	1

_Guil._	1
(R.)	1
O,	1
my	1
lord,	1
if	1
my	1
duty	1
be	1
too	1
bold,	1
my	1
love	1
is	1
too	1
unmannerly.[102]	1
_Ham._	1
(C.)	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
well	1

that.	1
Will	1
you	1

upon	1
this	1

_Guil._	1
My	1

I	1

_Ham._	1

pray	1
you.	1

Believe	1

_Ham._	1
I	1

beseech	1
you.	1
_Ros._	1
(L.)	1
I	1
know	1
no	1
touch	1
of	1

my	1
lord.	1
_Ham._	1
'Tis	1
as	1
easy	1

govern	1

your	1

thumb,	1
give	1
it	1
breath	1

you,	1

_Guil._	1
But	1
these	1

_Ham._	1
Why,	1
look	1
you	1
now,	1
how	1
unworthy	1
a	1
thing	1
you	1
make	1
of	1
me!	1
You	1
would	1
play	1
upon	1
me;	1
you	1
would	1
seem	1
to	1
know	1
my	1
stops;	1
you	1
would	1
pluck	1
out	1
the	1

would	1
sound	1
me	1
from	1
my	1
lowest	1
note	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
my	1
compass:	1

there	1
is	1
much	1
music,	1
excellent	1
voice,	1
in	1
this	1
little	1
organ;	1
yet	1
cannot	1
you	1
make	1
it	1
speak.	1
'Sdeath,	1
do	1

No	1

_Ham._	1
A	1

_Ham._	1
On	1

you,	1
how	1
pale	1
he	1
glares!	1
His	1
form	1

cause	1
conjoin'd,	1
preaching	1
to	1

Would	1
make	1
them	1
capable.[135]	1
Do	1
not	1
look	1
upon	1
me;	1
Lest	1
with	1
this	1
piteous	1

you	1
convert	1
My	1
stern	1

then	1
what	1

Will	1
want	1

_Queen._	1
To	1

_Ham._	1
Do	1

_Queen._	1
Nothing	1
at	1

yet	1
all	1
that	1
is,	1
I	1
see.[137]	1
_Ham._	1
Nor	1
did	1
you	1
nothing	1
hear?	1
_Queen._	1
No,	1
nothing	1

ourselves.	1
_Ham._	1
Why,	1

there!	1
look,	1

O,	1
throw	1

the	1

live	1

Good	1

Once	1

For	1
this	1

[_Pointing	1

I	1
do	1

sea	1

wind,	1

both	1
contend	1

is	1

mightier:	1
In	1

lawless	1
fit,	1
Behind	1
the	1
arras	1
hearing	1
something	1
stir,	1
Whips	1
out	1
his	1
rapier,	1
cries	1
_A	1
rat,	1
a	1
rat!_	1
And,	1
in	1
this	1
brainish	1
apprehension,[2]	1
kills	1
The	1
unseen	1
good	1
old	1
man.	1

heavy	1
deed!	1

we	1
been	1
there:	1

is	1
he	1
gone?	1
_Queen._	1

draw	1
apart	1
the	1
body	1
he	1
hath	1
kill'd.	1
_King._	1
The	1
sun	1
no	1
sooner	1
shall	1
the	1

touch,	1
But	1
we	1
will	1
ship	1
him	1
hence:	1

deed	1
We	1
must,	1
with	1
all	1
our	1
majesty	1

skill,	1
Both	1
countenance	1

excuse.--Ho,	1

Polonius	1
slain,	1

from	1

him:	1

done.	1

man	1
goes	1
loose!	1

not	1

put	1
the	1

him:	1

not	1
in	1
their	1
judgment,	1

is	1
weigh'd,	1
But	1
never	1
the	1
offence.[3]	1

hath	1
befallen?	1

Where	1
the	1

is	1
bestowed,	1
my	1
lord,	1

he?	1
_Ros._	1
Without,	1

Bring	1
him	1

in	1

Now,	1
Hamlet,	1
where's	1
Polonius?	1
_Ham._	1
(R.)	1
At	1
supper.	1
_King._	1
At	1
supper?	1
Where?	1
_Ham._	1
Not	1
where	1
he	1
eats,	1
but	1
where	1
he	1
is	1
eaten:	1
a	1
certain	1
convocation	1
of	1
politick	1
worms[4]	1
are	1
e'en	1
at	1
him.	1
_King._	1
Where's	1
Polonius?	1
_Ham._	1
In	1
Heaven;	1
send	1
thither	1
to	1
see:	1
if	1
your	1
messenger	1
find	1
him	1
not	1
there,	1
seek	1
him	1
i'the	1
other	1
place	1
yourself.	1
But,	1
indeed,	1
if	1
you	1
find	1
him	1
not	1
within	1
this	1
month,	1
you	1
shall	1
nose	1
him	1
as	1
you	1
go	1
up	1
the	1
stairs	1
into	1
the	1
lobby.	1
_King._	1
Go	1
seek	1
him	1
there.	1
[_To_	1

_Ham._	1
He	1
will	1
stay	1
till	1
you	1
come.	1

Hamlet,	1
this	1
deed,	1
for	1
thine	1
especial	1
safety,	1
Must	1
send	1
thee	1
hence:	1
Therefore	1
prepare	1
thyself;	1
The	1
bark	1
is	1
ready,	1
and	1
the	1
wind	1
at	1
help,[5]	1
For	1
England.	1
_Ham._	1
For	1
England!	1
_King._	1
Ay,	1
Hamlet.	1
_Ham._	1
Good.	1
_King._	1
So	1
is	1
it,	1
if	1
thou	1
knew'st	1
our	1
purposes.	1
_Ham._	1
I	1
see	1
a	1
cherub	1
that	1
sees	1
them.	1
But,	1
come;	1
for	1
England!--Farewell,	1
dear	1
mother.	1
_King._	1
Thy	1
loving	1
father,	1
Hamlet.	1
_Ham._	1
My	1
mother:	1
Father	1
and	1
mother	1
is	1
man	1
and	1
wife;	1
man	1
and	1
wife	1
is	1
one	1
flesh;	1
and	1
so,	1
my	1
mother.	1
Come,	1
for	1
England.	1
[_Exit_,	1

_King._	1
Follow	1
him	1
at	1

tempt	1

Away!	1

everything	1
is	1
seal'd	1
and	1
done.	1
[_Exeunt_	1

And,	1
England,	1
if	1
my	1
love	1
thou	1
hold'st	1
at	1
aught,	1
Thou	1
may'st	1
not	1
coldly	1
set[6]	1
Our	1
sovereign	1
process;[7]	1
which	1
imports	1
at	1
full,	1
By	1
letters	1
conjuring	1
to	1
that	1
effect,[8]	1
The	1
present	1
death	1
of	1
Hamlet.	1
Do	1
it,	1
England;	1
For	1
thou	1
must	1
cure	1
me:	1
'Till	1
I	1
know	1
'tis	1

Howe'er	1

asking	1

HAMLET.	1
What	1
should	1
this	1
mean?	1
Are	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
come	1
back?	1
Or	1
is	1
it	1
some	1
abuse,	1
and	1
no	1
such	1
thing?	1
_Laer._	1
(R.)	1
Know	1
you	1
the	1
hand?	1
_King._	1
(L.)	1
'Tis	1
Hamlet's	1
character:[38]	1
_Naked,--_	1
And	1
in	1
a	1
postscript	1
here,	1
he	1
says,	1
_alone_.	1
Can	1
you	1
advise	1
me?	1
_Laer._	1
I	1
am	1
lost	1
in	1
it,	1
my	1
lord.	1
But	1
let	1
him	1
come;	1
It	1
warms	1
the	1
very	1
sickness	1
in	1
my	1
heart,	1
That	1
I	1
shall	1
live	1
and	1
tell	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
teeth,	1
_Thus	1
diddest	1
thou_.	1
_King._	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
so,	1
Laertes,	1
Will	1
you	1
be	1
rul'd	1
by	1
me?	1
_Laer._	1
Ay,	1
my	1
lord;	1
So	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
o'er-rule	1
me	1
to	1
a	1
peace.	1
_King._	1
To	1
thine	1
own	1
peace.	1
Some	1
two	1
months	1
since,	1
Here	1
was	1
a	1
gentleman	1
of	1
Normandy,	1
He	1
made	1
confession	1
of[39]	1
you;	1
And	1
gave	1
you	1
such	1
a	1
masterly	1
report,	1
For	1
art	1
and	1
exercise	1
in	1
your	1
defence,[40]	1
And	1
for	1
your	1
rapier	1
most	1
especially,	1
That	1
he	1
cried	1
out,	1
'twould	1
be	1
a	1
sight	1
indeed,	1
If	1
one	1
could	1
match	1
you:	1
this	1
report	1
of	1
his	1
Did	1
Hamlet	1
so	1
envenom	1
with	1
his	1
envy,	1
That	1
he	1
could	1
nothing	1
do	1
but	1
wish	1
and	1
beg	1
Your	1
sudden	1
coming	1
o'er,	1
to	1
play	1
with	1
you.	1
Now,	1
out	1
of	1
this,----	1
_Laer._	1
What	1
out	1
of	1
this,	1
my	1
lord?	1
_King._	1
Laertes,	1
was	1
your	1
father	1
dear	1
to	1
you?	1
Or	1
are	1
you	1
like	1
the	1
painting	1
of	1
a	1
sorrow,	1
A	1
face	1
without	1
a	1
heart?	1
_Laer._	1
Why	1
ask	1
you	1
this?	1
_King._	1
Hamlet	1
return'd	1
shall	1
know	1
you	1
are	1
come	1
home:	1
We'll	1
put	1
on	1
those	1
shall	1
praise	1
your	1
excellence,	1
And	1
set	1
a	1
double	1
varnish	1
on	1
the	1
fame	1
The	1
Frenchman	1
gave	1
you;	1
bring	1
you,	1
in	1
fine,	1
together,	1
And	1
wager	1
o'er	1
your	1
heads;	1
he,	1
being	1
remiss,[41]	1
Most	1
generous,	1
and	1
free	1
from	1
all	1
contriving,	1
Will	1
not	1
peruse	1
the	1
foils:[42]	1
so	1
that,	1
with	1
ease,	1
Or	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
shuffling,	1
you	1
may	1
choose	1
A	1
sword	1
unbated,[43]	1
and,	1
in	1
a	1
pass	1
of	1
practice,[44]	1
Requite	1
him	1
for	1
your	1
father.	1
_Laer._	1
I	1
will	1
do't:	1
And,	1
for	1
the	1
purpose,	1
I'll	1
anoint	1
my	1
sword.	1
I	1
bought	1
an	1
unction	1
of	1
a	1
mountebank,	1
So	1
mortal,	1
that	1
but	1
dip	1
a	1
knife	1
in	1
it,	1
Where	1
it	1
draws	1
blood	1
no	1
cataplasm[45]	1
so	1
rare,	1
Collected	1
from	1
all	1
simples[46]	1
that	1
have	1
virtue	1
Under	1
the	1
moon,	1
can	1
save	1
the	1
thing	1
from	1
death	1
That	1
is	1
but	1
scratch'd	1
withal:	1
I'll	1
touch	1
my	1
point	1
With	1
this	1
contagion,	1
that,	1
if	1
I	1
gall	1
him	1
slightly,	1
It	1
may	1
be	1
death.	1
_King._	1
(L.)	1
Let's	1
further	1
think	1
of	1
this;	1
We'll	1
make	1
a	1
solemn	1
wager	1
on	1
your	1
cunnings,[47]	1
When	1
in	1
your	1
motion[48]	1
you	1
are	1
hot	1
and	1
dry,	1
(As	1
make	1
your	1
bouts	1
more	1
violent	1
to	1
that	1
end,)	1
And	1
that	1
he	1
calls	1
for	1
drink,	1
I'll	1
have	1
prepared	1
him	1
A	1
chalice	1
for	1
the	1
nonce;[49]	1
whereon	1
but	1
sipping,	1
If	1
he	1
by	1
chance	1
escape	1
your	1
venom'd	1
stuck,[50]	1
Our	1
purpose	1
may	1
hold	1
there.	1
But	1
stay,	1
what	1
noise?	1
_Enter_	1
QUEEN	1
(R.C.)	1
_Queen._	1
(C.)	1
One	1
woe	1
doth	1
tread	1
upon	1
another's	1
heel,	1
So	1
fast	1
they	1
follow:	1
Your	1
sister's	1
drown'd,	1
Laertes.	1
_Laer._	1
(R.)	1
Drown'd!	1
O,	1
where?	1
_Queen._	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
willow	1
grows	1
aslant	1
a	1
brook,	1
That	1
shows	1
his	1
hoar	1
leaves	1
in	1
the	1
glassy	1
stream;	1
Therewith	1
fantastick	1
garlands	1
did	1
she	1
make	1
Of	1
crow-flowers,	1
nettles,	1
daisies,	1
and	1
long	1
purples;[51]	1
There,	1
on	1
the	1
pendent	1
boughs	1
her	1
cornet	1
weeds	1
Clambering	1
to	1
hang,	1
an	1
envious	1
sliver	1
broke;	1
When	1
down	1
her	1
weedy	1
trophies,	1
and	1
herself,	1
Fell	1
in	1
the	1
weeping	1
brook.	1
_Laer._	1
I	1
forbid	1
my	1
tears:	1
But	1
yet	1
It	1
is	1
our	1
trick:[52]	1
nature	1
her	1
custom	1
holds,	1
Let	1
shame	1
say	1
what	1
it	1
will:	1
when	1
these	1
are	1
gone,	1
The	1
woman	1
will	1
be	1
out.[53]	1
Adieu,	1
my	1
lord:	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
speech	1
of	1
fire,	1
that	1
fain	1
would	1
blaze,	1
But	1
that	1
this	1
folly	1
drowns	1
it.[54]	1

was	1
carried	1
at	1
funerals	1

wore	1
at	1
weddings.	1
It	1
was	1
also	1
considered	1
the	1
emblem	1

fidelity	1

at	1
weddings	1

columbine	1
was	1
anciently	1
supposed	1

Probably	1
a	1

here,	1
as	1
_rue_	1
anciently	1
signified	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
_ruth_,	1
_i.e._,	1
sorrow.	1
In	1
the	1
common	1
dictionaries	1
of	1
Shakespeare's	1
time,	1
it	1
was	1

of.--MALONE.]	1
[Footnote	1
IV.28:	1
_You	1
may	1
wear	1
your	1
rue	1
with	1
a	1
difference._]	1
_i.e._,	1
to	1
distinguish	1
it	1
from	1
that	1
worn	1
by	1
Ophelia,	1
herself:	1
because	1
her	1
tears	1
flowed	1
from	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
a	1
father--those	1
of	1
the	1
Queen	1
ought	1
to	1
flow	1
for	1
her	1
guilt.]	1
[Footnote	1
IV.29:	1
_There's	1
a	1
daisy:_]	1
A	1
daisy	1

women,	1
not	1
to	1
trust	1
the	1
fair	1

_Thought	1

Thought	1
here,	1
as	1
in	1
many	1
other	1

means	1
melancholy.]	1

IV.33:	1
_I	1

your	1

_i.e._,	1
confer,	1

[Footnote	1
IV.34:	1
_No	1
trophy,	1
sword,	1
nor	1
hatchment	1
o'er	1
his	1

Not	1
only	1
the	1

but	1
the	1
helmet,	1
gauntlet,	1
spurs,	1
and	1
tabard,	1
(_i.e._,	1
a	1

ACT	1

SCENE	1
I.--A	1
CHURCH	1
YARD.	1
_Enter	1
two_	1
Clowns,[1]	1
_with	1
spades,	1
&c._	1
(L.H.U.E.)	1
_1st	1
Clo._	1
(R.)	1
Is	1
she	1
to	1
be	1
buried	1
in	1
christian	1
burial	1
that	1
wilfully	1
seeks	1
her	1
own	1
salvation?	1
_2nd	1
Clo._	1
(L.)	1
I	1
tell	1
thee	1
she	1
is;	1
therefore	1
make	1
her	1
grave	1
straight:[2]	1
the	1
crowner[3]	1
hath	1
set	1
on	1
her,	1
and	1
finds	1
it	1
christian	1
burial.	1
_1st	1
Clo._	1
How	1
can	1
that	1
be,	1
unless	1
she	1
drowned	1
herself	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
defence?	1
_2nd	1
Clo._	1
Why,	1
'tis	1
found	1
so.	1
_1st	1
Clo._	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
_se	1
offendendo_;[4]	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
else.	1
For	1
here	1
lies	1
the	1
point:	1
If	1
I	1
drown	1
myself	1
wittingly,	1
it	1
argues	1
an	1
act:	1
and	1
an	1
act	1
hath	1
three	1
branches;	1
it	1
is,	1
to	1
act,	1
to	1
do,	1
and	1
to	1
perform:[5]	1
argal,[6]	1
she	1
drowned	1
herself	1
wittingly.	1
_2nd	1
Clo._	1
Nay,	1
but	1
hear	1
you,	1
goodman	1
delver.[7]	1
_1st	1
Clo._	1
Give	1
me	1
leave.	1
Here	1
lies	1
the	1
water;	1
good:	1
here	1
stands	1
the	1
man;	1
good:	1
If	1
the	1
man	1
go	1
to	1
this	1
water,	1
and	1
drown	1
himself,	1
it	1
is,	1
will	1
he,	1
nill	1
he,	1
he	1
goes,[8]	1
mark	1
you	1
that;	1
but	1
if	1
the	1
water	1
come	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
drown	1
him,	1
he	1
drowns	1
not	1
himself:	1
argal,	1
he	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
guilty	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
death	1
shortens	1
not	1
his	1
own	1
life.	1
_2nd	1
Clo._	1
But	1
is	1
this	1
law?	1
_1st	1
Clo._	1
Ay,	1
marry	1
is't;	1
crowner's-quest	1
law.[9]	1
_2nd	1
Clo._	1
Will	1
you	1
ha'	1
the	1
truth	1
on't?	1
If	1
this	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
a	1
gentlewoman,	1
she	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
buried	1
out	1
of	1
christian	1
burial.	1
_1st	1
Clo._	1
Why,	1
there	1
thou	1
say'st:[10]	1
And	1
the	1
more	1
pity	1
that	1
great	1
folks	1
should	1
have	1
countenance	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
to	1
drown	1
or	1
hang	1
themselves,	1
more	1
than	1
their	1
even	1
christian.[11]	1
Come,	1
my	1
spade.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
ancient	1
gentlemen	1
but	1
gardeners,	1
ditchers,	1
and	1
grave-makers:	1
they	1
hold	1
up	1
Adam's	1
profession.	1
_2nd	1
Clo._	1
Was	1
he	1
a	1
gentleman?[12]	1
_1st	1
Clo._	1
He	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
that	1
ever	1
bore	1
arms.	1
I'll	1
put	1
another	1
question	1
to	1
thee:	1
if	1
thou	1
answerest	1
me	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
purpose,	1
confess	1
thyself----[13]	1
_2nd	1
Clo._	1
Go	1
to.	1
_1st	1
Clo._	1
What	1
is	1
he	1
that	1
builds	1
stronger	1
than	1
either	1
the	1
mason,	1
the	1
shipwright,	1
or	1
the	1
carpenter?	1
_2nd	1
Clo._	1
The	1
gallows-maker;	1
for	1
that	1
frame	1
outlives	1
a	1
thousand	1
tenants.	1
_1st	1
Clo._	1
I	1
like	1
thy	1
wit	1
well,	1
in	1
good	1
faith:	1
the	1
gallows	1
does	1
well;	1
But	1
how	1
does	1
it	1
well?	1
it	1
does	1
well	1
to	1
those	1
that	1
do	1
ill:	1
now,	1
thou	1
dost	1
ill	1
to	1
say	1
the	1
gallows	1
is	1
built	1
stronger	1
than	1
the	1
church:	1
argal,	1
the	1
gallows	1
may	1
do	1
well	1
to	1
thee.	1
To't	1
again,	1
come.	1
_2nd	1
Clo._	1
Who	1
builds	1
stronger	1
than	1
a	1
mason,	1
a	1
shipwright,	1
or	1
a	1
carpenter?	1
_1st	1
Clo._	1
Ay,	1
tell	1
me	1
that,	1
and	1
unyoke.[14]	1
_2nd	1
Clo._	1
Marry,	1
now	1
I	1
can	1
tell.	1
_1st	1
Clo._	1
To't.	1
_2nd	1
Clo._	1
Mass,	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell.	1
_1st	1
Clo._	1
Cudgel	1
thy	1
brains	1
no	1
more	1
about	1
it,[15]	1
for	1
your	1
dull	1
ass	1
will	1
not	1
mend	1
his	1
pace	1
with	1
beating;	1
and,	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
asked	1
this	1
question	1
next,	1
say,	1
a	1
grave-maker,	1
the	1
houses	1
that	1
he	1
makes,	1
last	1
till	1
doomsday.	1
Go,	1
get	1
thee	1
to	1
Yaughan,	1
and	1
fetch	1
me	1
a	1
stoup	1
of	1
liquor.[16]	1

at	1

_Hor._	1
(_On_	1
HAMLET'S	1

Custom	1

'Tis	1

_Ham._	1
That	1
skull	1
had	1
a	1
tongue	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
could	1
sing	1
once:	1
How	1
the	1

jowls	1

as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
Cain's	1

that	1
did	1
the	1

This	1
might	1

the	1
pate	1

this	1

Cannot	1

every	1

that:	1
It	1
was	1
the	1

Ay,	1

why	1

Why,	1
because	1
he	1

he	1
shall	1

if	1

'tis	1

it?	1
_1st	1
Clo._	1
O,	1
a	1
mad	1
fellow's	1
it	1
was:	1
Whose	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
it	1
was?	1
_Ham._	1
Nay,	1
I	1
know	1
not.	1
_1st	1
Clo._	1
A	1
pestilence	1
on	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
mad	1
rogue!	1
he	1
poured	1
a	1
flagon	1
of	1
Rhenish	1
on	1
my	1
head	1
once.	1
This	1
same	1
skull,	1
sir,	1
was	1
Yorick's	1
skull,	1
the	1
king's	1
jester.	1
_Ham._	1
This?	1
[_Takes	1
the	1
skull._]	1
_1st	1
Clo._	1
E'en	1
that.	1
_Ham._	1
Alas,	1
poor	1
Yorick!	1
I	1
knew	1
him,	1
Horatio:	1
a	1
fellow	1
of	1
infinite	1
jest,	1
of	1
most	1
excellent	1
fancy:	1
he	1
hath	1
borne	1
me	1
on	1
his	1
back	1
a	1
thousand	1
times.	1
Here	1
hung	1
those	1
lips	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
kissed	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
how	1
oft;	1
and	1
now,	1
how	1
abhorred	1
in	1
my	1
imagination	1
it	1
is!	1
Where	1
be	1
your	1
gibes	1
now?	1
your	1
gambols?	1
your	1
songs?	1
your	1
flashes	1
of	1
merriment,	1
that	1
were	1
wont	1
to	1
set	1
the	1
table	1
on	1
a	1
roar?	1
Not	1
one	1
now,	1
to	1
mock	1
your	1
own	1
grinning?	1
Quite	1
chap-fallen?	1
Now	1
get	1
you	1
to	1
my	1
lady's	1
chamber,	1
and	1
tell	1
her,	1
let	1
her	1
paint	1
an	1
inch	1
thick,	1
to	1
this	1
favour[26]	1
she	1
must	1
come;	1
make	1
her	1
laugh	1
at	1
that.	1
Prithee,	1
Horatio,	1
tell	1
me	1
one	1
thing.	1
_Hor._	1
What's	1
that,	1
my	1
lord?	1
_Ham._	1
Dost	1
thou	1
think	1
Alexander	1
look'd	1
o'this	1
fashion	1
i'the	1
earth?	1
_Hor._	1
E'en	1
so.	1
_Ham._	1
And	1
smelt	1
so?	1
pah!	1
[_Gives	1
the	1
skull	1
to	1
HORATIO,	1
who	1
returns	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
grave-digger._]	1
_Hor._	1
E'en	1
so,	1
my	1
lord.	1
_Ham._	1
To	1
what	1
base	1
uses	1
may	1
we	1
return,	1
Horatio!	1
Why	1
may	1
not	1
imagination	1
trace	1
the	1
noble	1
dust	1
of	1
Alexander,	1
till	1
it	1
find	1
it	1
stopping	1
a	1
bung-hole?	1
_Hor._	1
'Twere	1
to	1
consider	1
too	1
curiously,[27]	1
to	1
consider	1
so.	1
_Ham._	1
No,	1
faith,	1
not	1
a	1
jot;	1
but	1
to	1
follow	1
him	1
thither	1
with	1
modesty	1
enough,	1
and	1
likelihood	1
to	1
lead	1
it:	1
As	1
thus;	1
Alexander	1
died,	1
Alexander	1
was	1
buried,	1
Alexander	1
returneth	1
to	1
dust;	1
the	1
dust	1
is	1
earth;	1
of	1
earth	1
we	1
make	1
loam;	1
And	1
why	1
of	1
that	1
loam,	1
whereto	1
he	1
was	1
converted,	1
might	1
they	1
not	1
stop	1
a	1
beer	1
barrel?	1
Imperial	1
Cæsar,[28]	1
dead	1
and	1
turn'd	1
to	1
clay,	1
Might	1
stop	1
a	1
hole	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
wind	1
away:	1
O,	1
that	1
the	1
earth,	1
which	1
kept	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
awe,	1
Should	1
patch	1
a	1
wall	1
to	1
expel	1
the	1
winter's	1
flaw![29]	1
But	1
soft!	1
but	1
soft!	1
aside:	1
Here	1
comes	1
the	1
king,	1
The	1
queen,	1
the	1
courtiers:	1
Who	1
is	1
this	1
they	1
follow?	1
And	1
with	1
such	1
maimèd	1
rites?[30]	1
This	1
doth	1
betoken	1
The	1
corse	1
they	1
follow	1
did	1
with	1
desperate	1
hand	1
Fordo	1
its	1
own	1
life:[31]	1
'Twas	1
of	1
some	1
estate.[32]	1

(R.	1

Her	1

in	1

fear:	1
Hold	1
off	1
thy	1

Hamlet!	1
_Ham._	1
(R.C.)	1
Why,	1
I	1
will	1
fight	1
with	1
him	1
upon	1
this	1
theme	1
Until	1
my	1
eyelids	1
will	1
no	1
longer	1
wag.	1
_Queen._	1
O	1
my	1
son,	1
what	1
theme?	1
_Ham._	1
I	1
lov'd	1
Ophelia:	1
forty	1
thousand	1
brothers	1
Could	1
not,	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
quantity	1
of	1
love,	1
Make	1
up	1
my	1
sum.--What	1
wilt	1
thou	1
do	1
for	1
her?	1
_Queen._	1
O,	1
he	1
is	1
mad,	1
Laertes.	1
_Ham._	1
Come,	1
show	1
me	1
what	1
thou'lt	1
do:	1
Wou'lt	1
weep?	1
wou'lt	1
fight?	1
wou'lt	1
fast?	1
wou'lt	1
tear	1
thyself?	1
I'll	1
do't.--Dost	1
thou	1
come	1
here	1
to	1
whine?	1
To	1
outface	1
me[41]	1
with	1
leaping	1
in	1
her	1
grave?	1
Be	1
buried	1
quick	1
with	1
her,	1
and	1
so	1
will	1
I:	1
And,	1
if	1
thou	1
prate	1
of	1
mountains,	1
let	1
them	1
throw	1
Millions	1
of	1
acres	1
on	1
us,	1
till	1
our	1
ground,[42]	1
Singeing	1
his	1
pate	1
against	1
the	1
burning	1
zone,	1
Make	1
Ossa[43]	1
like	1
a	1
wart!	1
Nay,	1
an	1
thou'lt	1
mouth,	1
I'll	1
rant	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
thou.	1
_Queen._	1
This	1
is	1
mere	1
madness:	1
And	1
thus	1
a	1
while	1
the	1
fit	1
will	1
work	1
on	1
him;	1
Anon,	1
as	1
patient	1
as	1
the	1
female	1
dove,	1
When	1
that	1
her	1
golden	1
couplets	1
are	1
disclos'd,[44]	1
His	1
silence	1
will	1
sit	1
drooping.	1
_Ham._	1
Hear	1
you,	1
sir;	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
reason	1
that	1
you	1
use	1
me	1
thus?	1
I	1
lov'd	1
you	1
ever:	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
matter;	1
Let	1
Hercules	1
himself	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
may,	1
The	1
cat	1
will	1
mew,[45]	1

But	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
sorry,	1
good	1
Horatio,	1
That	1
to	1
Laertes	1
I	1
forgot	1
myself;	1
For	1
by	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
my	1
cause,[48]	1
I	1
see	1
The	1
portraiture	1
of	1
his.	1
_Hor._	1
Peace!	1
who	1
comes	1
here?	1
_Enter_	1
OSRIC	1
(L.H.)	1
_Osr._	1
Your	1
lordship	1
is	1
right	1
welcome	1
back	1
to	1
Denmark.	1
_Ham._	1
(C.)	1
I	1
humbly	1
thank	1
you,	1
sir.--Dost	1
know	1
this	1
water-fly?[49]	1
_Hor._	1
(R.)	1
No,	1
my	1
good	1
lord.	1
_Ham._	1
Thy	1
state	1
is	1
the	1
more	1
gracious;	1
for	1
'tis	1
a	1
vice	1
to	1
know	1
him.	1
_Osr._	1
(L.)	1
Sweet	1
lord,	1
if	1
your	1
lordship	1
were	1
at	1
leisure,	1
I	1
should	1
impart	1
a	1
thing	1
to	1
you	1
from	1
his	1
majesty.	1
_Ham._	1
I	1
will	1
receive	1
it,	1
sir,	1
with	1
all	1
diligence	1
of	1
spirit.[50]	1
Your	1
bonnet	1
to	1
his	1
right	1
use;	1
'tis	1
for	1
the	1
head.	1
_Osr._	1
I	1
thank	1
your	1
lordship,	1
'tis	1
very	1
hot.	1
_Ham._	1
No,	1
believe	1
me,	1
'tis	1
very	1
cold;	1
the	1
wind	1
is	1
northerly.	1
_Osr._	1
It	1
is	1
indifferent	1
cold,	1
my	1
lord,	1
indeed.	1
_Ham._	1
But	1
yet,	1
methinks	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
sultry	1
and	1
hot,[51]	1
for	1
my	1
complexion,--	1
_Osr._	1
Exceedingly,	1
my	1
lord;	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
sultry,	1
as	1
'twere,--I	1
cannot	1
tell	1
how.--But,	1
my	1
lord,	1
his	1
majesty	1
bade	1
me	1
signify	1
to	1
you,	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
laid	1
a	1
great	1
wager	1
on	1
your	1
head:	1
Sir,	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
matter,--	1
_Ham._	1
I	1
beseech	1
you,	1
remember----	1
[HAMLET	1
_moves	1
him	1
to	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
hat._]	1
_Osr._	1
Nay,	1
good	1
my	1
lord;	1
for	1
mine	1
ease,	1
in	1
good	1
faith.[52]	1
Sir,	1
here	1
is	1
newly	1
come	1
to	1
court	1
Laertes;	1
believe	1
me,	1
an	1
absolute	1
gentleman,	1
full	1
of	1
most	1
excellent	1
differences,	1
of	1
very	1
soft	1
society	1
and	1
great	1
showing:[53]	1
Indeed,	1
to	1
speak	1
feelingly	1
of	1
him,[54]	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
card	1
or	1
calendar	1
of	1
gentry,[55]	1
for	1
you	1
shall	1
find	1
in	1
him	1
the	1
continent	1
of	1
what	1
part	1
a	1
gentleman	1
would	1
see.[56]	1
_Ham._	1
What	1
imports	1
the	1
nomination	1
of	1
this	1
gentleman?[57]	1
_Osr._	1
Of	1
Laertes?	1
_Ham._	1
Of	1
him,	1
sir.	1
_Osr._	1
Sir,	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
ignorant	1
of	1
what	1
excellence	1
Laertes	1
is--	1
_Ham._	1
I	1
dare	1
not	1
confess	1
that,	1
lest	1
I	1
should	1
compare	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
excellence;	1
but,	1
to	1
know	1
a	1
man	1
well,	1
were	1
to	1
know	1
himself.[58]	1
_Osr._	1
I	1
mean,	1
sir,	1
for	1
his	1
weapon.	1
_Ham._	1
What	1
is	1
his	1
weapon?	1
_Osr._	1
Rapier	1
and	1
dagger.	1
_Ham._	1
That's	1
two	1
of	1
his	1
weapons:	1
but,	1
well.	1
_Osr._	1
The	1
king,	1
sir,	1
hath	1
wagered	1
with	1
him	1
six	1
Barbary	1
horses:	1
against	1
the	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
imponed,[59]	1
as	1
I	1
take	1
it,	1
six	1
French	1
rapiers	1
and	1
poignards,	1
with	1
their	1
assigns,	1
as	1
girdle,	1
hangers,[60]	1
or	1
so:	1
Three	1
of	1
the	1
carriages,	1
in	1
faith,	1
are	1
very	1
dear	1
to	1
fancy,	1
very	1
responsive	1
to	1
the	1
hilts,	1
most	1
delicate	1
carriages,	1
and	1
of	1
very	1
liberal	1
conceit.[61]	1
_Ham._	1
What	1
call	1
you	1
the	1
carriages?	1
_Osr._	1
The	1
carriages,	1
sir,	1
are	1
the	1
hangers.	1
_Ham._	1
The	1
phrase	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
german[62]	1
to	1
the	1
matter,	1
if	1
we	1
could	1
carry	1
cannon	1
by	1
our	1
sides.	1
_Osr._	1
The	1
king,	1
sir,	1
hath	1
laid,	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
dozen	1
passes	1
between	1
yourself	1
and	1
him,	1
he	1
shall	1
not	1
exceed	1
you	1
three	1
hits;	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
come	1
to	1
immediate	1
trial,	1
if	1
your	1
lordship	1
would	1
vouchsafe	1
the	1
answer.[63]	1
_Ham._	1
How	1
if	1
I	1
answer	1
no?[64]	1
_Osr._	1
I	1
mean,	1
my	1
lord,	1
the	1
opposition	1
of	1
your	1
person	1
in	1
trial.	1
_Ham._	1
Sir,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
breathing	1
time	1
of	1
day	1
with	1
me;	1
let	1
the	1
foils	1
be	1
brought,	1
the	1
gentleman	1
willing,	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
hold	1
his	1
purpose,	1
I	1
will	1
win	1
for	1
him	1
if	1
I	1
can;	1
if	1
not,	1
I	1
will	1
gain	1
nothing	1
but	1
my	1
shame	1
and	1
the	1
odd	1
hits.	1
_Osr._	1
Shall	1
I	1
deliver	1
you	1
so?	1
_Ham._	1
To	1
this	1
effect,	1
sir;	1
after	1
what	1
flourish	1
your	1
nature	1
will.	1
_Osr._	1
I	1
commend	1
my	1
duty	1
to	1
your	1
lordship.	1
[_Exit_,	1
L.H.]	1
_Hor._	1
(R.)	1
You	1
will	1
lose	1
this	1
wager,	1
my	1
lord.	1
_Ham._	1
(C.)	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
so;	1
since	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
France,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
continual	1
practice;	1
I	1
shall	1
win	1
at	1
the	1
odds.[65]	1
But	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
not	1
think	1
how	1
ill	1
all's	1
here	1
about	1
my	1
heart:	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
matter.	1
_Hor._	1
Nay,	1
good	1
my	1
lord.	1
_Ham._	1
It	1
is	1
but	1
foolery;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
gain-giving,[66]	1
as	1
would,	1
perhaps,	1
trouble	1
a	1
woman.	1
_Hor._	1
If	1
your	1
mind	1
dislike	1
any	1
thing,	1
obey	1
it:[67]	1
I	1
will	1
forestall	1
their	1
repair	1
hither,	1
and	1
say,	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
fit.	1
_Ham._	1
Not	1
a	1
whit,	1
we	1
defy	1
augury:	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
special	1
providence	1
in	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
a	1
sparrow.	1

Come,	1

take	1
this	1
hand	1
from	1
me.	1
_Ham._	1
(_offering	1
his	1

LAERTES)	1
Give	1
me	1
your	1
pardon,	1
sir:	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
you	1
wrong;	1
But	1
pardon	1
it,	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
gentleman.	1

from	1
a	1
purpos'd	1
evil	1
Free	1
me	1
so	1
far	1
in	1
your	1
most	1
generous	1
thoughts,	1
That	1
I	1
have	1
shot	1
my	1
arrow	1
o'er	1
the	1
house,	1
And	1
hurt	1
my	1
brother.	1
_Laer._	1
(R.)	1
I	1
am	1
satisfied	1
in	1
nature,	1
Whose	1
motive,	1
in	1
this	1
case,	1
should	1
stir	1
me	1
most	1
To	1
my	1
revenge.	1
I	1
do	1
receive	1
your	1
offer'd	1
love	1
like	1
love,	1
And	1
will	1
not	1
wrong	1
it.	1
_Ham._	1
I	1
embrace	1
it	1
freely:	1
And	1
will	1
this	1
brother's	1
wager	1
frankly	1
play.	1
Give	1
us	1
the	1
foils.	1
_Laer._	1
Come,	1
one	1
for	1
me.	1
_Ham._	1
I'll	1
be	1
your	1
foil,	1
Laertes:	1
in	1
mine	1
ignorance	1
Your	1
skill	1
shall,	1
like	1
a	1
star	1
i'the	1
darkest	1
night,	1
Stick	1
fiery	1
off	1
indeed.[68]	1
_Laer._	1
You	1
mock	1
me,	1
sir.	1
_Ham._	1
No,	1
by	1
this	1
hand.	1
_King._	1
Give	1
them	1
the	1
foils,	1
young	1
Osric.	1
Cousin	1
Hamlet,	1
You	1
know	1
the	1
wager?	1
_Ham._	1
Very	1
well,	1
my	1
lord;	1
Your	1
grace	1
hath	1
laid	1
the	1
odds	1
o'the	1
weaker	1
side.	1
_King._	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
fear	1
it;	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
you	1
both:	1
But	1
since	1
he's	1
better'd,[69]	1
we	1
have	1
therefore	1
odds.	1
_Laer._	1
This	1
is	1
too	1
heavy,	1
let	1
me	1
see	1
another.	1
_Ham._	1
This	1
likes	1
me	1
well.	1
These	1

have	1
all	1

_Osr._	1
Ay,	1

lord.	1

in	1

cup	1
an	1
union	1
shall	1

throw,[72]	1
Richer	1

that	1
which	1

[Pages	1

thine;	1

awhile.	1
[Page	1

do	1
not	1

I	1

I	1

you,	1
pardon	1
me.	1

the	1
poison'd	1
cup;	1
it	1

too	1
late.	1
[_Aside._]	1
_Laer._	1
I'll	1

him	1
now	1
And	1

it	1

conscience.	1
[_Aside._]	1

Come,	1
